National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH-2015),Substance Abuse &amp; Mental Health Services Administration,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-survey-on-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-2015,"<p>The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) series (formerly titled National Household Survey on Drug Abuse) primarily measures the prevalence and<br />     correlates of drug use in the United States. The surveys are designed to provide quarterly  as well as annual estimates. Information is provided on the use<br />     of illicit drugs  alcohol  and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as<br />     lifetime  annual  and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana  cocaine (and crack)  hallucinogens  heroin  inhalants  alcohol  tobacco <br />     and nonmedical use of prescription drugs  including pain relievers  tranquilizers  stimulants  and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment<br />     history and perceived need for treatment  and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic<br />     criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were<br />     also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts  health care access and coverage  illegal activities and arrest record  problems resulting<br />     from the use of drugs  and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2015 survey  including questions asked<br />     only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These ""youth experiences"" items covered a variety of topics  such as neighborhood environment  illegal activities  drug<br />     use by friends  social support  extracurricular activities  exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs  and perceived adult attitudes<br />     toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on<br />     mental health and access to care  perceived risk of using drugs  perceived availability of drugs  driving and personal behavior  and cigar smoking.<br />     Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey  adult mental health questions were added to<br />     measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008  a<br />     split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems.<br />     Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH  however  all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions. Background information includes gender  race <br />     age  ethnicity  marital status  educational level  job status  veteran status  and current household composition.This study has 1 Data Set.</p> ",1183,addiction;alcohol;alcohol abuse;alcohol consumption;amphetamines;barbiturates;cocaine;controlled drugs;crack cocaine;demographic characteristics;depression (psychology);drinking behavior;drug abuse;drug dependence;drug treatment;drug use;drugs;employment;hallucinogens;health care;heroin;households;income;inhalants;marijuana;mental health;mental health services;methamphetamine;pregnancy;prescription drugs;sedatives;smoking;stimulants;substance abuse;substance abuse treatment;tobacco use;tranquilizers;youths

500 Cities: Local Data for Better Health,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/500-cities-local-data-for-better-health-b32fd,"<p>This is the complete dataset for the 500 Cities project. This dataset includes 2013  2014 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5)  health outcomes (13)  and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  Division of Population Health  Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28 000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective  targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions  users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2013  2014)  Census Bureau 2010 census population data  and American Community Survey (ACS) 2009-2013  2010-2014 estimates.

Accidental Drug Related Deaths  2012-June 2017,data.ct.gov,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/accidental-drug-related-deaths-january-2012-sept-2015,"A listing of each accidental death associated with drug overdose in Connecticut from 2012 to June 2017. A ""Y"" value under the different substance columns indicates that particular substance was detected.    Data are derived from an investigation by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner which includes the toxicity report  death certificate  as well as a scene investigation.    The “Morphine (Not Heroin)” values are related to the differences between how Morphine and Heroin are metabolized and therefor detected in the toxicity results. Heroin metabolizes to 6-MAM which then metabolizes to morphine.  6-MAM is unique to heroin  and has a short half-life (as does heroin itself). Thus  in some heroin deaths  the toxicity results will not indicate whether the morphine is from heroin or prescription morphine. In these cases the Medical Examiner may be able to determine the cause based on the scene investigation (such as  finding heroin needles). If they find prescription morphine at the scene it is certified as “Morphine (not heroin).”  Therefor  the Cause of Death may indicate Morphine  but the Heroin or Morphine (Not Heroin) may not be indicated.     “Any Opioid” – If the Medical Examiner cannot conclude whether it’s RX Morphine or heroin based morphine in the toxicity results  that column may be checked",1161,death;drug;overdose;heroin;opioid;substance abuse

Air Quality Measures on the National Environmental Health Tracking Network,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/air-quality-measures-on-the-national-environmental-health-tracking-network,"<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides air pollution data about ozone and particulate matter (PM2.5) to CDC for the Tracking Network. The EPA maintains a database called the Air Quality System (AQS) which contains data from approximately 4 000 monitoring stations around the country  mainly in urban areas. Data from the AQS is considered the ""gold standard"" for determining outdoor air pollution. However  AQS data are limited because the monitoring stations are usually in urban areas or cities and because they only take air samples for some air pollutants every three days or during times of the year when air pollution is very high. CDC and EPA have worked together to develop a statistical model (Downscaler) to make modeled predictions available for environmental public health tracking purposes in areas of the country that do not have monitors and to fill in the time gaps when monitors may not be recording data. This data does not include ""Percent of population in counties exceeding NAAQS (vs. population in counties that either meet the standard or do not monitor PM2.5)"".

Allegheny County Property Sale Transactions,Allegheny County / City of Pittsburgh / Western PA Regional Data Center,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/allegheny-county-property-sale-transactions,"This dataset contains data on all Real Property parcels that have sold since 2012 in Allegheny County  PA.    Before doing any market analysis on property sales  check the sales validation codes. Many property ""sales"" are not considered a valid representation of the true market value of the property. For example  when multiple lots are together on one deed with one price they are generally coded as invalid (""H"") because the sale price for each parcel ID number indicates the total price paid for a group of parcels  not just for one parcel. See the Sales Validation Codes Dictionary for a complete explanation of valid and invalid sale codes.    Sales Transactions Disclaimer: Sales information is provided from the Allegheny County Department of Administrative Services  Real Estate Division. Content and validation codes are subject to change. Please review the Data Dictionary for details on included fields before each use. Property owners are not required by law to record a deed at the time of sale. Consequently the assessment system may not contain a complete sales history for every property and every sale. You may do a deed search at http://www.alleghenycounty.us/re/index.aspx directly for the most updated information.

Index; Violent; Property; and Firearm Rates By County: Beginning 1990,State of New York,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/index-violent-property-and-firearm-rates-by-county-beginning-1990,The Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS) collects crime reports from more than 500 New York State police and sheriffs’ departments. DCJS compiles these reports as New York’s official crime statistics and submits them to the FBI under the National Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. UCR uses standard offense definitions to count crime in localities across America regardless of variations in crime laws from state to state. In New York State  law enforcement agencies use the UCR system to report their monthly crime totals to DCJS. The UCR reporting system collects information on seven crimes classified as Index offenses which are most commonly used to gauge overall crime volume. These include the violent crimes of murder/non-negligent manslaughter  forcible rape  robbery  and aggravated assault; and the property crimes of burglary  larceny  and motor vehicle theft. Firearm counts are derived from taking the number of violent crimes which involve a firearm. Population data are provided every year by the FBI  based on US Census information. Police agencies may experience reporting problems that preclude accurate or complete reporting. The counts represent only crimes reported to the police but not total crimes that occurred.,233,index crime;public safety;firearms;ucr

It is also important to note that fact and attribute field relationships are not always 1-to-1.

Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO),NRCS,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/soil-survey-geographic-ssurgo-database-for-various-soil-survey-areas-in-the-united-states-,This dataset is a digital soil survey and generally is the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing maps  by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing  or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information.    This dataset consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area extent format and include a detailed  field verified inventory of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale  but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System relational database  which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.    SSURGO depicts information about the kinds and distribution of soils on the landscape. The soil map and data used in the SSURGO product were prepared by soil scientists as part of the National Cooperative Soil Survey.,565,NGDA;NGDA Portfolio Theme;National Geospatial Data Asset;SSURGO.;Soil Survey Geographic;Soil Survey Geographic.;Soil survey;Soils Theme;soils

Average Daily Traffic Counts,data.cityofchicago.org,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/average-daily-traffic-counts-3968f,Average Daily Traffic (ADT) counts are analogous to a census count of vehicles on city streets. These counts provide a close approximation to the actual number of vehicles passing through a given location on an average weekday. Since it is not possible to count every vehicle on every city street  sample counts are taken along larger streets to get an estimate of traffic on half-mile or one-mile street segments. ADT counts are used by city planners  transportation engineers  real-estate developers  marketers and many others for myriad planning and operational purposes.  Data Owner: Transportation.  Time Period: 2006.  Frequency: A citywide count is taken approximately every 10 years. A limited number of traffic counts will be taken and added to the list periodically.

Autonomous Vehicle Survey of Bicyclists and Pedestrians in Pittsburgh; 2017,Allegheny County / City of Pittsburgh / Western PA Regional Data Center,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/autonomous-vehicle-survey-of-bicyclists-and-pedestrians-in-pittsburgh-2017,In Pittsburgh  Autonomous Vehicle (AV) companies have been testing autonomous vehicles since September 2016. However  the tech is new  and there have been some high-profile behavior that we believe warrants a larger conversation. So in early 2017  we set out to design a survey to see both how BikePGH donor-members  and Pittsburgh residents at large  feel about about sharing the road with AVs as a bicyclist and/or as a pedestrian. Our survey asked participants how they feel about being a fellow road user with AVs  either walking or biking. We also wanted to collect stories about people’s experiences interacting with this nascent technology. We are unaware of any public surveys about people’s feelings or understanding of this new technology.  We hope that our results will help add to the body of data and help the public and politicians understand the complexity of possible futures that different economic models AV technology can bring to our cities and towncenters.  We conducted our survey in two parts. First  we launched the survey exclusively to donor-members  yielding 321 responses (out of 2 900) via email. Once we closed the survey  we launched it again  but allowed the general public to take it. Through promoting it on our website  social media channels  and a few news articles  we yielded 798 responses (mostly from people in the Pittsburgh region)  for a combined total of 1 119 responses.,90,accident;argo;auto;automobile;autonomous vehicle;av;avs;bicycle;bicyclists;bike;bike lane;bikepgh;car;crash;crosswalk;ford;pedestrian;pittsburgh;public safety;robot;robots;safety;self driving car;self-driving car;share the road;sidewalk;streets;survey;taxi;tech;technology;transportation;uber;waymo

National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH-2014),Substance Abuse &amp; Mental Health Services Administration,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-survey-on-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-2014,"<p>The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) series (formerly titled National Household Survey on Drug Abuse) primarily measures the prevalence and correlates of drug use in the United States. The surveys are designed to provide quarterly  as well as annual  estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs  alcohol  and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime  annual  and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana  cocaine (and crack)  hallucinogens  heroin  inhalants  alcohol  tobacco  and nonmedical use of prescription drugs  including pain relievers  tranquilizers  stimulants  and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment  and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts  health care access and coverage  illegal activities and arrest record  problems resulting from the use of drugs  and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2014 survey  including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These ""youth experiences"" items covered a variety of topics  such as neighborhood environment  illegal activities  drug use by friends  social support  extracurricular activities  exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs  and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and access to care  perceived risk of using drugs  perceived availability of drugs  driving and personal behavior  and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey  adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008  a split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems. Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH  however  all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions. Background information includes gender  race  age  ethnicity  marital status  educational level  job status  veteran status  and current household composition.<br /> This study has 1 Data Set.</p> ",100,addiction;alcohol;alcohol abuse;alcohol consumption;amphetamines;barbiturates;cocaine;controlled drugs;crack cocaine;demographic characteristics;depression (psychology);drinking behavior;drug abuse;drug dependence;drug treatment;drug use;drugs;employment;hallucinogens;health care;heroin;households;income;inhalants;marijuana;mental health;mental health services;methamphetamine;pregnancy;prescription drugs;sedatives;smoking;stimulants;substance abuse;substance abuse treatment;tobacco use;tranquilizers;youths

Supply Chain Shipment Pricing Data,USAID,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/supply-chain-shipment-pricing-data,This data set provides supply chain health commodity shipment and pricing data. Specifically  the data set identifies Antiretroviral (ARV) and HIV lab shipments to supported countries. In addition  the data set provides the commodity pricing and associated supply chain expenses necessary to move the commodities to countries for use.  The dataset has similar fields to the Global Fund's Price  Quality and Reporting (PQR) data.  PEPFAR and the Global Fund represent the two largest procurers of HIV health commodities.  This dataset  when analyzed in conjunction with the PQR data  provides a more complete picture of global spending on specific health commodities. The data are particularly valuable for understanding ranges and trends in pricing as well as volumes delivered by country.  The US Government believes this data will help stakeholders make better  data-driven decisions.  Care should be taken to consider contextual factors when using the database.  Conclusions related to costs associated with moving specific line items or products to specific countries and lead times by product/country will not be accurate.,406,PEPFAR;Supply Chain;antiretroviral drugs;ARV

FSM constructs  if scenarios for best options (i.e.  best parameters) prior to making a GDP decision.  Modeling may be used by: (1) the ARTCC Traffic Management Coordinator (TMC) to request ATCSCC implementation of a GDP in the event of significant congestion or if a demand imbalance is projected at an en route fix  route  or sector; (2) the ATCSCC to determine Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) start times  Airport Arrival Rate (AAR)  and other parameters for a particular GDP scenario; and (3) the Airlines to see the effects of canceling or delaying a specific flights under a GDP.,-1,flight;traffic;route;airport;weather;airspace;surface
SAT School Participation and Performance: 2012-2013,data.ct.gov,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/sat-school-participation-and-performance-2012-2013,This dataset contains data by school on student SAT scores relative to the SAT College and Career Readiness (CCR) Benchmark score of 1550 (critical reading  mathematics and writing sections combined) for the graduating classes of 2012 and 2013.  According to research conducted by the College Board*  a score of 1550 indicates that a student will have a 65 percent or greater likelihood of achieving a B- average or higher during the first year of college.    This dataset also provides an estimated SAT Participation Rate  which equals the number of SAT test-taking seniors in the school divided by the number of seniors enrolled in the school as a percentage.  These participation rates are considered an estimate because the grade level of the SAT test-taker is self-reported by the student at the time of registration for the SAT while the total number of seniors enrolled in the school is reported to the Connecticut State Department of Education (CSDE) by the district. These are the best available estimates of SAT participation rates.    The Benchmark Performance reflect the results of only those who participate in the SAT.  Because participation rates vary from school to school  the CSDE provides both the estimated Participation rates together with the Benchmark Performance in order to promote fair and valid comparisons across schools.     Note: The data are suppressed when there are too few test-takers to sufficiently protect privacy.    *The research report can be found at:  http://research.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/publications/2012/7/researchreport-2011-5-sat-college-readiness-benchmark-secondary-performance.pdf,207,education;school;sat

Census Data,US Bureau of the Census,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/census-data,The Bureau of the Census has released Census 2000 Summary File 1 (SF1) 100-Percent data. The file includes the following population items: sex  age  race  Hispanic or Latino origin  household relationship  and household and family characteristics. Housing items include occupancy status and tenure (whether the unit is owner or renter occupied). SF1 does not include information on incomes  poverty status  overcrowded housing or age of housing. These topics will be covered in Summary File 3. Data are available for states  counties  county subdivisions  places  census tracts  block groups  and  where applicable  American Indian and Alaskan Native Areas and Hawaiian Home Lands. The SF1 data are available on the Bureau's web site and may be retrieved from American FactFinder as tables  lists  or maps. Users may also download a set of compressed ASCII files for each state via the Bureau's FTP server. There are over 8000 data items available for each geographic area. The full listing of these data items is available here as a downloadable compressed data base file named TABLES.ZIP. The uncompressed is in FoxPro data base file (dbf) format and may be imported to ACCESS  EXCEL  and other software formats. While all of this information is useful  the Office of Community Planning and Development has downloaded selected information for all states and areas and is making this information available on the CPD web pages. The tables and data items selected are those items used in the CDBG and HOME allocation formulas plus topics most pertinent to the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS)  the Consolidated Plan  and similar overall economic and community development plans. The information is contained in five compressed (zipped) dbf tables for each state. When uncompressed the tables are ready for use with FoxPro and they can be imported into ACCESS  EXCEL  and other spreadsheet  GIS and database software. The data are at the block group summary level. The first two characters of the file name are the state abbreviation. The next two letters are BG for block group. Each record is labeled with the code and name of the city and county in which it is located so that the data can be summarized to higher-level geography. The last part of the file name describes the contents . The GEO file contains standard Census Bureau geographic identifiers for each block group  such as the metropolitan area code and congressional district code. The only data included in this table is total population and total housing units. POP1 and POP2 contain selected population variables and selected housing items are in the HU file. The MA05 table data is only for use by State CDBG grantees for the reporting of the racial composition of beneficiaries of Area Benefit activities. The complete package for a state consists of the dictionary file named TABLES  and the five data files for the state.

Food Expenditures,Economic Research Service  U.S. Department of Agriculture,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/food-expenditures,The ERS Food Expenditure Series annually measures total U.S. food expenditures  including purchases by consumers  governments  businesses  and nonprofit organizations. The ERS Food Expenditure Series contributes to the analysis of U.S. food production and consumption by constructing a comprehensive measure of the total value of all food expenditures by final purchasers. This series annually measures total U.S. food expenditures  including purchases by consumers  governments  businesses  and nonprofit organizations. Because the term expenditure is often associated with household decisionmaking  it is important to recognize that ERS's series also includes nonhousehold purchases. For example  the series includes the dollar value of domestic food purchases by military personnel and their dependents at military commissary stores and exchanges  the value of commodities and food dollars donated by the Federal government to schools  and the value of food purchased by airlines for serving during flights.,168,agricultural economics;expenditures;food

NCHS - Drug Poisoning Mortality by State: United States,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/drug-poisoning-mortality-u-s-and-state-trends-united-states-20022014,<p>This dataset describes drug poisoning deaths at the U.S. and state level by selected demographic characteristics  and includes age-adjusted death rates for drug poisoning from 1999 to 2015.</p> <p>Deaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases  Tenth Revision (ICDâ10). Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICDâ10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40âX44 (unintentional)  X60âX64 (suicide)  X85 (homicide)  or Y10âY14 (undetermined intent).</p> <p>Estimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100 000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011â2015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.</p> <p>Estimate does not meet standards of reliability or precision. Death rates are flagged as âUnreliableâ in the chart when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less.</p> <p>Death rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICDâ10 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99  âOther ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortalityâ (2). For example  this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Estimates should be interpreted with caution.</p> <p>Smoothed county age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100 000 population) were obtained according to methods described elsewhere (3â5). Briefly  two-stage hierarchical models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning for each year during 1999â2015. These annual county-level estimates âborrow strengthâ across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (3 5). Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County  Colo.  and Denali County  Alaska  before 2003 (6 7). Additionally  Bedford City  Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015.

Solar Resources by Class and Country,National Renewable Energy Laboratory,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/solar-resources-by-class-and-country,These estimates are derived from the best available solar resource data available to NREL.  Resources are organized by class and country.  Resolution varies spatially from 1 km to 1 degree (approximately 100 km) depending on the data source.  High spatial resolution datasets (1 km to 40 km cells) were modeled to support country or regional projects.  Where high resolution datasets were not available  data from NASA’s Surface Meteorology and Solar Energy (SSE) version 6 database were used.      The data represent total potential solar energy per year as a function of land area per solar class (`KWh/m²/day`).  Each solar class correlates to a specific `0.5 kWh/m²/day` range.  Energy is calculated by multiplying the productive land by the class  conversion efficiency and number of days per year.  In this case  a standard calendar year of 365 days was used.  The conversion efficiency rate applied was 10%.    `E = Productive Land * kWh/m²/day * 365 days * 10% efficiency`    The solar data has been derived from solar data measured or modeled between 1961  and 2008  depending on the dataset.,61,DNI;NASA;NREL;SSE;clean energy;energy;international;lat;resource assessment;solar;solar energy;solar per country;solar potential;solar power;solar resource;tilt

U.S. General Soil Map (STATSGO2),NRCS,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-general-soil-map-statsgo2-for-the-united-states-of-america,This dataset consists of general soil association units. It was developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey and supersedes the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) dataset published in 1994. It consists of a broad based inventory of soils and non-soil areas that occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped of 1:250 000 in the continental U.S.  Hawaii  Puerto  and the Virgin Islands and 1:1 000 000 in Alaska. The dataset was created by generalizing more detailed soil survey maps. Where more detailed soil survey maps were not available  data on geology  topography  vegetation  and climate were assembled  together with Land Remote Sensing Satellite (LANDSAT) images. Soils of like areas were studied  and the probable classification and extent of the soils were determined.    Map unit composition was determined by transecting or sampling areas on the more detailed maps and expanding the data statistically to characterize the entire map unit.    This dataset consists of georeferenced vector digital data and tabular digital data. The map data were collected in 1- by 2-degree topographic quadrangle units and merged into a seamless national dataset. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information system relational database  which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.      These data provide information about soil features on or near the surface of the Earth. Data were collected as part of the National Cooperative Soil Survey. These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the state  regional  and national level. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:250 000-scale data.,565,General Soil Map;NGDA;National Geospatial Data Asset;STATSGO;STATSGO2;Soils;Soils Theme;State Soil Geographic

This means that data coming from users associated with a particular organization may be ""trusted"" more than data from other unknown users. Each registered user is assigned a default ""score"" based on their organizational affiliation. This score is highest for Government users (State  Federal  etc.) because such users are often involved with incentive programs that have a defined data collection process in place. Second are utility and PV installers (and others in the PV industry)  and so on. All users who contribute data to the project have the ability to gain a ""project reputation"" that can impact the score of the data they contribute.  Validation.  Data validation occurs on each record in the database on a regular basis. The database is continually analyzed for corrupt records  bad or invalid data  and outliers such as an abnormal cost to watt ratio. Records found to contain questionable data are flagged and are dealt with on a case by case basis by a member of the Open PV Team.  Duplication.  Understanding duplication is one of the ways that individual records are validated. In a publicly contributed database  it is imperative to anticipate the submission of duplicate records. When duplicate records are detected  they are added to an install specific list of duplicates and the data provided are aggregated into ""summary records"" of their respective installs. Identifying duplicate records helps validate PV installs in the database. The more a PV installation is duplicated in the database  the more trust the project places on the data for that installation.  Data Fields. Required Fields. The Open PV Project is designed to be able to store nearly any type of information pertaining to PV installations. In order to provide the primary statistics from the database we have identified 4 data fields that are required of each PV install added to the project. These four fields are:  -  Date Installed (Completion date or interconnection date) -  Size/Capacity of the PV Installation (in kW DC) -  Location (Zipcode or Street Address) -  Total Installed Cost (in USD  before incentives). Additional Fields. The four required fields listed above provide the Open PV Project with the base information needed to derive several key statistics on the US PV market  including historical trends and regional comparisons. However  the design of the Open PV database is capable of storing nearly any type of data associated with PV installation  so the Open PV Team would like to encourage you to contribute any additional information you are comfortable sharing. This extra information can be extremely valuable  for example  data that contains information about who installed the PV installation can help to answer very useful questions about where certain installers are working. Information on module or inverter types can be useful in mapping efficiency and detailed financing information can be a key factor in understanding trends in overall installation cost. The Open PV Team strongly encourages you to contribute any data you feel comfortable providing  especially data you would like to see visualized in our gallery someday.",149,NREL;Open PV;PV;deployment database;market statistics;photovoltaic;renewable energy;solar;solar deployment;solar energy;solar panel

National Patient Care Database (NPCD),Department of Veterans Affairs,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-patient-care-database-npcd,The National Patient Care Database (NPCD)  located at the Austin Information Technology Center  is part of the National Medical Information Systems (NMIS).  The NPCD collects integrated patient care data from all Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) IT systems.  Data recorded in the VistA Patient Care Encounter (PCE) package  which captures clinical data resulting from ambulatory care patient encounters is transmitted to the NPCD using the Ambulatory Care Reporting (ACR) Module of the VistA Patient Information Management System (PIMS) package. The Ambulatory Care Reporting Module provides necessary information on patient treatment  what services were rendered to patients  who provided the services  and whether services reported were synchronized with the VA medical center database. Directive 2006-026 (05/05/2006) required the inclusion to patient care data capture requirements the capture of inpatient encounters for patients seen in outpatient clinics and inpatient billable professional services.Additionally  NPCD includes VistA Spinal Cord Dysfunction (SCD) package and Primary Care Management Module (PCMM) data. The SCD central registry in NPCD is used to provide VA-wide review of patient demographics  clinical aspects of injury and disease  and resource utilization involved in providing care to patients.   As of October 2010  data for the Spinal Cord Dysfunction is being maintained in the Spinal Cord Injury and Disorders Outcomes (SCIDO) database; current SCD data in NPCD is residual data only.  The data load and extraction process for SCD data in NPCD will be discontinued in FY12. The PCMM data in NPCD includes primary care patient to provider assignments and provider utilization data.The NPCD is used by Veterans Health Administration (VHA) program offices for a wide variety of tasks to include research and budget allocation to medical centers.,-1,cpt;diagnosis;encounter;icd;icd-9;outpatient;procedure;provider;va;veteran;workload

School districts then applied to state for the funds this spring. When school districts applied  they were required to indicate that they would implement one of the following four models in their persistently lowest achieving schools: Turnaround Model: Replace the principal  screen existing school staff  and rehire no more than half the teachers; adopt a new governance structure; and improve the school through curriculum reform  professional development  extending learning time  and other strategies. Restart Model: Convert a school or close it and re-open it as a charter school or under an education management organization. School Closure: Close the school and send the students to higher-achieving schools in the district.

Fair Market Rents (FMRs) are primarily used to determine payment standard amounts for the Housing Choice Voucher program  to determine initial renewal rents for some expiring project-based Section 8 contracts  to determine initial rents for housing assistance payment (HAP) contracts in the Moderate Rehabilitation Single Room Occupancy program (Mod Rehab)  and to serve as a rent ceiling in the HOME rental assistance program. FMRs are gross rent estimates. They include the shelter rent plus the cost of all tenant-paid utilities  except telephones  cable or satellite television service  and internet service. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) annually estimates FMRs for 530 metropolitan areas and 2 045 nonmetropolitan county FMR areas. Under certain conditions  as set forth in the Interim Rule (Federal Register Vol. 65  No. 191  Monday October 2  2000  pages 58870-58875)  these 50th percentile rents can be used to set success rate payment standards.,564,HUD;fmr;housing assistance;rents;section 8 contracts

Report on bees collected at selected Midwestern US Fish and Wildlife Refuges 2012 to 2013,Fish and Wildlife Service,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/report-on-bees-collected-at-selected-midwestern-us-fish-and-wildlife-refuges-2012-to-2013,Bee conservation  broadly speaking  has four main objectives:  1) to conserve the individual species of native bees  2) to conserve the ecological services (pollination of native plants) provided by native bees  3) to  bring more native bee species into  agricultural service  and  4) to maintain the health and viability of honey bees for agricultural purposes. Three of these objectives relate directly to native habitats  and in order to  begin to address  them it is necessary to identify which bee species are present within a particular geography  and to gain a basic understanding of the span of their ecological tolerances and  abundance. Native habitats and communities offer the best starting point  for this effort because  they are reservoirs of biodiversity compared to disturbed areas  urban parks  habitat reconstructions  etc.  The project summarized in these following pages  initiated in 2012 and enabled by staff and volunteers and the US Fish and Wildlife Service  is a first step towards identifying and documenting the bee species present  on selected refuges in the Midwest  and  also provides limited data on their ecological amplitude and  abundance.        Collecting effort  in 2013 varied from refuge to refuge  as did the number of sampling sites and the intent or design of the survey at each refuge. Some refuges were interested in comparing remnants to reconstructions  others compared different native habitat types  others were simply interested in an overall survey of the refuge. The value of the data to each refuge is largely proportional to the effort expended  but even limited collecting effort provided some valuable data.,135,Floodplain;Grasslands;Inventory;Native Bees;Refuges;General: Biology | Communities and Ecosystems | Grassland/Herbaceous;General: Biology | Communities and Ecosystems | Riverine;General: Biology | Species | Invertebrates;General: Biology | Species | Pollinators

The GE2011 rates are for informational purposes only and  as such  do not invoke any regulatory requirements  sanctions  or other adverse action. These informational rates were prepared in advance of the July 1  2012 effective date of the applicable regulations for the years in which programs that fail the debt measures will be required to provide debt warnings and may lose eligibility after failing three out of four consecutive years. Key statistics produced from GE2011 were information on repayment rates and debt-to-earnings ratios.,253,Educational program;Degree;Gainful employment;Recognized occupation;Repayment rate;Average annual earnings;Annual loan payments;Debt-to-earnings ratio

Regents Exam Results,data.cityofnewyork.us,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/regents-exam-results,Regents results by School for all subjects  by year.    Cohorts of 2001 through 2011 (Classes of 2005 through 2015)  Graduation Outcomes as Calculated by the New York State Education Department  The New York State calculation method was first adopted for the Cohort of 2001 (Class of 2005).  The cohort consists of all students who first entered 9th grade in a given school year (e.g.  the Cohort of 2006 entered 9th grade in the 2006-2007 school year).  Graduates are defined as those students earning either a Local or Regents diploma and exclude those earning either a special education (IEP) diploma or GED.     In order to comply with FERPA regulations on public reporting of education outcomes  rows with a cohort of 20 or fewer students are suppressed.  Due to the small number of students identified as Native American or Multi-Racial  these ethnicities are not reported on the Ethnicity tab; however  these students are included in the counts on all other tabs.  4 Year August outcomes are available for the 2004-2011 cohorts at the citywide level and for the 2005-2011 cohorts at the borough  district and school level. 5 Year August outcomes are available for the 2006-2010 cohorts. Cells are blank when data is not available.  Charter schools are not included in the NYSED calculation of graduation rates for NYC.  School level results are not presented for District 79 and District 75 schools  but their outcomes are included in citywide totals.  Starting with the 2009 cohort (Class of 2013)  students with IEPs could use the compensatory score option (CSO) to meet graduation requirements  which contributed to an increase in the graduation rate.   Students are considered English Language Learners by NY State if classified as an ELL as of graduation.,110,regents;exams;schools;graduation

NCHS - Drug Poisoning Mortality by County: United States,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/drug-poisoning-mortality-county-trends-united-states-20022014,<p>This dataset describes drug poisoning deaths at the county level by selected demographic characteristics and includes age-adjusted death rates for drug poisoning from 1999 to 2015.</p> <p>Deaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases  Tenth Revision (ICDâ10). Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICDâ10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40âX44 (unintentional)  X60âX64 (suicide)  X85 (homicide)  or Y10âY14 (undetermined intent).</p> <p>Estimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100 000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011â2015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.</p> <p>Estimate does not meet standards of reliability or precision. Death rates are flagged as âUnreliableâ in the chart when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less.</p> <p>Death rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICDâ10 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99  âOther ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortalityâ (2). For example  this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Estimates should be interpreted with caution.</p> <p>Smoothed county age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100 000 population) were obtained according to methods described elsewhere (3â5). Briefly  two-stage hierarchical models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning for each year during 1999â2015. These annual county-level estimates âborrow strengthâ across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (3 5). Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County  Colo.  and Denali County  Alaska  before 2003 (6 7). Additionally  Bedford City  Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015.

500 Cities: Local Data for Better Health,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/500-cities-local-data-for-better-health,<p>This is the complete dataset for the 500 Cities project. This dataset includes 2013  2014 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5)  health outcomes (13)  and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  Division of Population Health  Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28 000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective  targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions  users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2013  2014)  Census Bureau 2010 census population data  and American Community Survey (ACS) 2009-2013  2010-2014 estimates.

Alternative Fuels Data Center,DOE,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/alternative-fuels-data-center,Find alternative fueling stations near an address or ZIP code or along a route in the United States. Enter a state to see a station count.  ## Data Collection Methods ##  The data in the Alternative Fueling Station Locator are gathered and verified through a variety of methods. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) obtains information about new stations from trade media  Clean Cities coordinators  an Add a Station form on the Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC) website  and through collaborating with infrastructure equipment and fuel providers.  NREL regularly compares its station data with those of other relevant trade organizations and websites. Differences in methodologies and inclusion criteria may result in slight differences between NREL's database and those maintained by other organizations. NREL also collaborates with alternative fuel industry groups to maintain the data. NREL and its data collection subcontractor are currently collaborating with natural gas  electric drive  biodiesel  ethanol  and propane industry groups to establish best practices for identifying new stations in the most-timely manner possible and to develop a more rigorous network for the future.  ## Station Update Schedule ##  Existing stations in the database are contacted at least once a year on an established schedule to verify they are still operational and dispensing the fuel specified. Based on an established data collection schedule  the database is updated once a month with the exception of electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) data  which are updated twice a month. Stations that are no longer operational or no longer provide alternative fuel are removed from the database on a monthly basis or as they are identified.  ## Mapping and Counting Methods ##  Each point on the map is counted as one station in the station count. A station appears as one point on the map  regardless of the number of fuel dispensers or charging outlets at that location. Station addresses are geocoded and mapped using an automatic geocoding application. The geocoding application returns the most accurate location based on the provided address. Station locations may also be provided by external sources (e.g.  station operators) and/or verified in a geographic information system (GIS) tool like Google Earth  Google Maps  or Google StreetView. This information is considered highly accurate  and these coordinates override any information generated using the geocoding application.  ## Notes about Specific Station Types ## ### Private Stations ### Stations with an Access of "Private - Fleet customers only" may allow other entities to fuel through a business-to-business arrangement. For more information  fleet customers should refer to the information listed in the details section for that station to contact the station directly.  ### Biodiesel Stations ### The Alternative Fueling Station Locator only includes stations offering biodiesel blends of 20% (B20) and above.  ### Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) ### An electric charging station  or EVSE  appears as one point on the map  regardless of the number of charging outlets at that location. The number and type of charging outlets available are displayed as additional details when the station location is selected. Each point on the map is counted as one station in the station count. To see a total count of EVSE for all outlets available  go to the Alternative Fueling Station Counts by State table. Residential EVSE locations are not included in the Alternative Fueling Station Locator.  ## Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Propane) Stations ### Because many propane stations serve customers other than drivers and fleets  NREL collaborated with the industry to effectively represent the differences. Each propane station is designated as a 'primary' or 'secondary' service type. Both types are able to fuel vehicles. However  locations with a 'primary' designation offer vehicle services and fuel priced specifically for use in vehicles. The details page for each station lists its service designation.,28,EV;EVSE;alternative fuels;biodiesel;charging stations;electric vehicles;gas stations;hydrogen;liquefied petroleum gas;lng

Hourly Energy Emission Factors for Electricity Generation in the United States,National Renewable Energy Laboratory,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/hourly-energy-emission-factors-for-electricity-generation-in-the-united-states,Emissions from energy use in buildings  are usually estimated on an annual basis using annual average multipliers.  Using annual numbers provides a reasonable  estimation of emissions  but it provides no indication of the temporal nature  of the emissions.  Therefore  there is no  way of understanding the impact on emissions from load  shifting and peak shaving technologies such as thermal energy storage  on-site  renewable energy  and demand control.      This project utilized GridViewTM  an  electric grid dispatch software package  to estimate hourly emission  factors for all of the [eGRID](http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-resources/egrid/) subregions in the continental United  States. These factors took into account electricity imports and exports  across the eGRID subregion boundary  and included estimated  transmission and distribution (T) losses.  Emission types accounted for included carbon dioxide (CO2)  nitrogen oxides (NOx)  and sulfur dioxide (SO2).Data  reported as part of this project include hourly average  minimum  and  maximum emission factors by month; that is  the average  minimum  and  maximum emission factor for the same hour of each day in a month.  Please note that the data are reported in lbs/MWh  where the MWh value  reported is site electricity use (the actual electricity used at the  building) and the pounds of emissions reported are the emissions  created at the generator to meet the building load  including  transmission and distribution losses.

Wind Energy Resource Data,DOE National Renewable Energy Laboratory,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/wind-energy-resource-data-fc121,NREL's Geographic Information System (GIS) team offers both a national wind resource assessment of the United States and high-resolution wind data. The national wind resource assessment was created for the U.S. Department of Energy in 1986 by the Pacific Northwest Laboratory and is documented in the Wind Energy Resource Atlas of the United States  October 1986. This national wind resource data provides an estimate of the annual average wind resource for the conterminous United States  with a resolution of 1/3 degree of latitude by 1/4 degree of longitude.  The wind resource assessment was based on surface wind data  coastal marine area data  and upper-air data  where applicable. In data-sparse areas  three qualitative indicators of wind speed or power were used when applicable: topographic/meteorological indicators (e.g. gorges  mountain summits  sheltered valleys); wind deformed vegetation; and eolian landforms (e.g. playas  sand dunes). The data was evaluated at a regional level to produce 12 regional wind resource assessments; the regional assessments were then incorporated into the national wind resource assessment.  The conterminous United States was divided into grid cells 1/4 degree of latitude by 1/3 degree of longitude. Each grid cell was assigned a wind power class ranging from 1 to 6  with 6 being the windiest. The wind power density limits for each wind power class are shown in Table 1-1. Each grid cell contains sites of varying power class. The assigned wind power class is representative of the range of wind power densities likely to occur at exposed sites within the grid cell. Hilltops  ridge crests  mountain summits  large clearings  and other locations free of local obstruction to the wind will be well exposed to the wind. In contrast  locations in narrow valleys and canyons  downwind of hills or obstructions  or in forested or urban areas are likely to have poor wind exposure.,31,energy resources;renewable energy;resource map;wind energy

Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW),Department of Veterans Affairs,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/corporate-data-warehouse-cdw,The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is increasingly dependent upon data.  Most of its employees generate and use vast amounts of data on a daily basis.  To improve our capacity for data analysis while providing the most efficient and the highest quality health care to our Veteran patients  VHA  working with the VA Office of Information and Technology  implemented a health data warehouse.  Central to this plan is consolidating data from disparate sources into a coherent single logical data model.  The Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) is the physical implementation of this logical data model at the enterprise level for VHA.   Although the CDW initially began to store data as early as 2006  a renewed effort began in 2010 to accelerate CDW&#039;s content by including more subject areas from Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) and content from other existing national data systems.  CDW supports fully developed subject areas in its production environment as well as supporting rapid prototyping by extracting data directly from source systems with very minor data transformations.  The Regional Data Warehouses and the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) Data Warehouses share content from CDW and allow for greater reporting flexibility at the local level throughout the VHA organization.,-1,domain;health;sql;va;veteran;visn;vista;warehouse

The data collection is conducted on the subset of institutions that appear on the tuition and fees and/or net price increase lists for being in the five percent of institutions in their institutional sector that have the highest increases  expressed as a percentage change  over the three-year time period. This data collection is mandatory and expects a 100 percent response rate. Key statistics produced from CATEF 2016–17 are a description of the major areas in the institution's budget with the greatest cost increases; an explanation of the cost increases; a description of the steps the institution will take toward the goal of reducing costs in the areas described; an explanation of the extent to which the institution participates in determining such cost increase; the identification of the agency or instrumentality of state government responsible for determining such cost increase; and any other information the institution considers relevant to the report.,25,Postsecondary institutions;Tuition and fees;Net prices;Cost of attendance;College affordability;Transparency of information
Food Inspection,data.montgomerycountymd.gov,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/food-inspection-475fc,The Licensure & Regulatory Services Program inspects all licensed retail food establishments in Montgomery County for a variety of reasons (e.g. obtaining a permit  regular check-ups  or in response to complaints.) Included in this overall surveillance are two types of inspections that are conducted on a routine basis. The first type  a comprehensive inspection  is a thorough inspection that evaluates the sanitation  maintenance  and food service operations for the facility. This inspection includes many of the items found in the monitoring inspection  such as critical temperatures and food handling procedures. The second type  a monitoring inspection  involves checking the food service operation for critical food temperatures  equipment temperatures  and general food handling / cleanliness practices. While monitoring inspections are not as detailed as environmental inspections  they help ensure that the facility is operating safely throughout the year.    The frequency of inspections is based on the food-borne illness risks associated with the food being processed at a facility. Based on the risk each facility is designated as high  medium  or low priority. High priority risk facilities prepare food products a day or more in advance or utilize any combination of two or more processes such as a cooking  cooling  reheating and hot holding food over four hours. Moderate priority risk facilities prepare and cook food products which are served immediately or within four hours. A low priority risk facility serve prepackage foods that are not potentially hazardous.    For high risk facilities  a monitoring inspection is conducted at least twice a year  and moderate risk facilities are inspected at least once a year. High and moderate risk facilities also receive at least one comprehensive inspection every year. Low risk priority facilities typically receive one comprehensive inspection every two years.    (C) Denotes a Critical Violation. A Critical Violation means a food safety requirement that requires immediate correction. Failure for immediate correction results in cessation of some or all food operations or closure of the facility until violation is able to be corrected.

National Health Interview Survey,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  Department of Health &amp; Human Services,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-health-interview-survey,<p>The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is the principal source of information on the health of the civilian noninstitutionalized population of the United States and is one of the major data collection programs of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) which is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The National Health Survey Act of 1956 provided for a continuing survey and special studies to secure accurate and current statistical information on the amount  distribution  and effects of illness and disability in the United States and the services rendered for or because of such conditions. The survey referred to in the Act  now called the National Health Interview Survey  was initiated in July 1957. Since 1960  the survey has been conducted by NCHS  which was formed when the National Health Survey and the National Vital Statistics Division were combined.<br /> NHIS data are used widely throughout the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to monitor trends in illness and disability and to track progress toward achieving national health objectives. The data are also used by the public health research community for epidemiologic and policy analysis of such timely issues as characterizing those with various health problems  determining barriers to accessing and using appropriate health care  and evaluating Federal health programs.<br /> The NHIS also has a central role in the ongoing integration of household surveys in DHHS. The designs of two major DHHS national household surveys have been or are linked to the NHIS. The National Survey of Family Growth used the NHIS sampling frame in its first five cycles and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey currently uses half of the NHIS sampling frame. Other linkage includes linking NHIS data to death certificates in the National Death Index (NDI).<br /> While the NHIS has been conducted continuously since 1957  the content of the survey has been updated about every 10-15 years. In 1996  a substantially revised NHIS questionnaire began field testing. This revised questionnaire  described in detail below  was implemented in 1997 and has improved the ability of the NHIS to provide important health information.</p> ,-1,centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-department-of-health-amp-human-services

Teachers' Use of Educational Technology in U.S. Public Schools; 2009,National Center for Education Statistics,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/teachers-use-of-educational-technology-in-u-s-public-schools-2009,Teachers' Use of Educational Technology in U.S. Public Schools  2009 (FRSS 95)  is a study that is part of the Fast Response Survey System (FRSS) program; program data is available since 1998-99 at <https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/frss/downloads.asp>. FRSS 95 (https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/frss/) is a sample survey that provides national estimates on the availability and use of educational technology among teachers in public elementary and secondary schools during 2009. This is one of a set of three surveys (at the district  school  and teacher levels) that collected data on a range of educational technology resources. The study was conducted using surveys via the web or by mail. Telephone follow-up for survey non-response and data clarification was also used. Questionnaires and cover letters for the teacher survey were mailed to sampled teachers at their schools. Public schools and teachers within those schools were sampled. The weighted response rate for schools providing lists of teachers for sampling was 81 percent  and the weighted response rate for sampled teachers completing questionnaires was 79 percent. Key statistics produced from FRSS 95 were information on the use of computers and internet access in the classroom; availability and use of computing devices  software  and school or district networks (including remote access) by teachers; students� use of educational technology; teachers� preparation to use educational technology for instruction; and technology-related professional development activities.,48,Information technology;Computers;Internet

National Forest System Trails (Feature Layer),U.S. Forest Service,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-forest-system-trails-feature-layer,The TrailNFS_Publish Layer is designed to provide information about National Forest System trail locations and characteristics to the public. When fully realized  it will describe trail locations  basic characteristics of the trail  and where and when various trail uses are prohibited  allowed and encouraged. Because the data readiness varies between Forests  each Forest will approve which level of attribute subset are published for that forest. Forests can provide no information or one of three attribute subsets describing trails. The attribute subsets include TrailNFS_Centerline which includes the location and trail name and number; TrailNFS_Basic which adds information about basic trail characteristics; and TrailNFS_Mgmt which adds information about where and when users are prohibited  allowed  and encouraged. When a Forest chooses to provide the highest attribute subset  TrailNFS_Mgmt  these attributes must be consistent with the Forest's published Motorized Vehicle Use Map (MVUM).

Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN-2011),Substance Abuse &amp; Mental Health Services Administration,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2011,<p>The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) is a nationally representative public health surveillance system that has monitored drug related emergency department (ED) visits to hospitals since the early 1970s. First administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)  the responsibility for DAWN now rests with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ). Over the years  the exact survey methodology has been adjusted to improve the quality  reliability  and generalizability of the information produced by DAWN. The current approach was first fully implemented in the 2004 data collection year.<br /> DAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample  a hospital must be a non-Federal  short-stay  general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States  with at least one 24-hour ED. DAWN cases are identified by the systematic review of ED medical records in participating hospitals. The unit of analysis is any ED visit involving recent drug use. DAWN captures both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. The reason a patient used a drug is not part of the criteria for considering a visit to be drug-related. Therefore  all types of drug-related events are included: drug misuse or abuse  accidental drug ingestion  drug-related suicide attempts  malicious drug poisonings  and adverse reactions. DAWN does not report medications that are unrelated to the visit.<br /> The DAWN public-use dataset provides information for all types of drugs  including illegal drugs  prescription drugs  over-the-counter medications  dietary supplements  anesthetic gases  substances that have psychoactive effects when inhaled  alcohol when used in combination with other drugs (all ages)  and alcohol alone (only for patients aged 20 or younger). Public-use dataset variables describe and categorize up to 22 drugs contributing to the ED visit  including toxicology confirmation and route of administration. Administrative variables specify the type of case  case disposition  categorized episode time of day  and quarter of year.  Metropolitan area is included for represented metropolitan areas. Created variables include the number of unique drugs reported and case-level indicators for alcohol  non-alcohol illicit substances  any pharmaceutical  non-medical use of pharmaceuticals  and all misuse and abuse of drugs. Demographic items include age category  sex  and race/ethnicity. Complex sample design and weighting variables are included to calculate various estimates of drug-related ED visits for the Nation as a whole  as well as for specific metropolitan areas  from the ED visits classified as DAWN cases in the selected hospitals.This study has 1 Data Set.</p> ,37,alcohol;demographic characteristics;detoxification;drug overdose;drug use;emergency departments;energy drinks;nonprescription drugs;substance abuse;suicide

Consumer Price Index - All Urban Consumers (Current Series),U.S. Department of Labor  Bureau of Labor Statistics,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-price-index-all-urban-consumers-current-series,The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a statistical measure of change  over time  of the prices of goods and services in major expenditure groups--such as food  housing  apparel  transportation  and medical care--typically purchased by urban consumers. Essentially  it compares the cost of a sample "market basket" of goods and services in a specific month relative to the cost of the same "market basket" in an earlier reference period. This reference period is designated as the base period. The revised CPI introduced by the BLS in 1998 includes indexes for two populations; urban wage earners and clerical workers (CW)  and all urban consumers (CU). As a result of the revision  both the CW and the CU utilize updated expenditure weights based upon data tabulated from three years (1982  1983  and 1984) of the Consumer Expenditure Survey and incorporate   a number of technical improvements  including an updated and revised item structure.,300,Cost of Living;Inflation;Prices

Governor's Children's Cabinet County Crime Rates And Population,data.illinois.gov,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/governors-childrens-cabinet-county-crime-rates-and-population,This dataset was compiled by the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) at the request of the Governor’s Children’s Cabinet. This data contains the population of youth ages 13-26 in each county  the total population of each county  and the number and rate of index crimes reported  with domestic violence offenses and rates reported separately for every year between 2006 and 2015.    For the purpose of this analysis the crime data was gathered from the Illinois State Police Annual report Crime in Illinois.  This publication is produced by the Illinois State Police every year using the UCR data that is submitted to them by individual jurisdictions throughout the state. The accuracy of this data presented is dependent on the local jurisdictions reporting their index crime and domestic violence offenses to ISP  so it can be included in the annual report.   Therefore  if there is large decrease in number of index crimes reported in the dataset it is likely that one or more jurisdictions did not report data for that year to ISP.  If there is a large increase from year to year within a county it is likely that a jurisdiction within the county  who previously had not reported crime data  did report crime data for that year.  If there is no reported crime in a certain year that means no jurisdictions  or a small jurisdiction with no crime from that county reported data to the Illinois State Police. The annual Crime in Illinois reports can be found on the ISP website www.isp.state.il.us.    A direct link to that annual reports is: http://www.isp.state.il.us/crime/ucrhome.cfm#anlrpts.  The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority did not record the data that is expressed in the dataset.  ICJIA simply used the ISP reports to compile that yearly crime data into one chart that could be provided to the Illinois Governor’s Children’s Cabinet. This data set has be critically examined to be accurate according to the annual Crime in Illinois Reports.  If there are issues with the data set provided please contact the Illinois State Police or the individual jurisdictions within a specific county.    **Index offenses do not include every crime event that occurs. Prior to 2014 there were 8 index crimes reported by the Illinois State Police in their annual reports  Criminal Homicide  Rape  Robbery  Aggravated Battery/Aggravated Assault  Burglary  Theft  Motor Vehicle Theft  and Arson.  In 2014 there were two new offenses added to the list of index crimes these were Human Trafficking – Commercial Sex Acts and Human Trafficking – Involuntary Servitude.  These are the index crimes that are recorded in the chart provided.    **“Domestic offenses are defined as offenses committed between family or household members. Family or household members include spouses; former spouses; parents; children; foster parents; foster children; legal guardians and their wards; stepchildren; other persons related by blood (aunt  uncle  cousin) or by present or previous marriage (in-laws); persons who share  or formerly shared  a common dwelling; persons who have  or allegedly have  a child in common; persons who share  or allegedly share  a blood relationship through a child; persons who have  or have had  a dating or engagement relationship; and persons with disabilities  their personal care assistants  or care givers outside the context of an employee of a public or private care facility. Every offense that occurs  when a domestic relationship exists between the victim and offender  must be reported (Illinois State Police).”  **“Offenses reported are not limited to domestic battery and violations of orders of protection; offenses most commonly associated with domestic violence (Illinois State Police).”  The crime rate was compiled using the total population  and the index crime.  The Index crime whether all crime or Domestic Violence crime was divided by the total population then multiplied by 10 000  hence crime rate per 10 000.    The sources of data are the Illinois Uniform Crime Reporting Program and the U.S. Census Bureau.

The surveys are designed to provide quarterly  as well as<br /> annual  estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit<br /> drugs  alcohol  and tobacco among members of United States households<br /> aged 12 and older. Questions include age at first use as well as<br /> lifetime  annual  and past-month usage for the following drug classes:<br /> marijuana  cocaine (and crack)  hallucinogens  heroin  inhalants <br /> alcohol  tobacco  and nonmedical use of prescription drugs  including<br /> pain relievers  tranquilizers  stimulants  and sedatives. The survey<br /> covers substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for<br /> treatment  and includes questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical<br /> Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be<br /> applied. Respondents are also asked about personal and family income<br /> sources and amounts  health care access and coverage  illegal<br /> activities and arrest record  problems resulting from the use of<br /> drugs  and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous NHSDA<br /> administrations were retained in the 2001 survey  including questions<br /> asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These "youth experiences"<br /> items covered a variety of topics  such as neighborhood environment <br /> illegal activities  gang involvement  drug use by friends  social<br /> support  extracurricular activities  exposure to substance abuse<br /> prevention and education programs  and perceived adult attitudes<br /> toward drug use and activities such as school work. Also retained were<br /> questions on mental health and access to care  perceived risk of using<br /> drugs  perceived availability of drugs  driving behavior and personal<br /> behavior  and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most<br /> often were introduced with the 1999 survey and have been retained<br /> through the 2001 survey. Demographic data include gender  race  age <br /> ethnicity  marital status  educational level  job status  veteran<br /> status  and current household composition.

The data collection was conducted using electronic data collection from school districts and online surveys of school districts and elementary and middle school teachers. Teachers in their first  second  or third year of teaching responsible for teaching to at least one general education classroom of fourth- through sixth-grade students were sampled. TSFG will compute value-added scores for teachers  based on students' state math and English language arts tests  and examine the relationships between teacher preparation experiences and teacher value-added scores.,-1,Elementary and secondary education;Teacher quality;Teacher preparation;Teacher effectiveness;First three years of teaching;Novice teachers

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Insured Banks,Under Secretary / Management,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-fdic-insured-banks,The Summary of Deposits (SOD) is the annual survey of branch office deposits for all FDIC-insured institutions including insured U.S. branches of foreign banks. Data are as of June 30. Users can access these data by(1) single institution  (2) institutions within a geographic area  or (3) aggregated within a geographic area. SOD features include custom market share reports and downloads.Linkhttp://www2.fdic.gov/sod/Scope of the SurveysTo provide a means for measuring deposits in local banking markets  the surveys obtain deposit figures for each banking office of branch banking systems  and for each insured U.S. branch of a foreign bank. Deposit figures for unit banks (which do not have branch offices) were obtained from the June Reports of Condition. Deposit Reporting - Institutions should report their deposits in a manner consistent with their existing internal record-keeping practices  however  other methods that logically reflect the deposit gathering activity of the bank's branches may be used. It is recognized that certain classes of deposits and deposits of certain types of customers may be assigned to a single office. Please refer to the reporting instructions for more information (see above). Arrangement of Published DataBecause these publications are used as a source of market share information for individual banking markets  the figures for each geographical area only include deposits of offices located within that area. Several institutions have designated home offices that do not accept deposits; these have been included in the survey to provide a more complete listing of all offices. Additional points that should be noted1. With the exception noted above  'banking office' is defined to include all offices and facilities that actually hold deposits  and does not include loan production offices  computer centers  and other nondeposit installations  such as automated teller machines (ATMs). 2. Institutions are allowed to combine deposit data from two or more offices within the same county for the following office typesdrive-in offices  seasonal branches  and military facilities. Where centralized bookkeeping or other conditions make it impossible to report exact figures  estimates are required. 3. International Banking Facility (IBF) deposits are considered deposits in foreign offices and are not included in the Summary of Deposits Survey. 4. Offices and deposits are reported by the institution that owned the office as of the close of business on June 30. 5. The term 'offices' includes both main offices and branches. An institution with four branches operates a total of five offices. 6. All reports submitted to the FDIC and the OTS have been validated and corrected to the extent possible. There may be rounding differences or minor reporting errors reflected in the tables. 7. Savings Institutions include all FDIC-Insured financial institutions that operate under federal or state thrift banking charters. Prior to August 9  1989  all institutions insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) and all savings banks insured by the FDIC are included in any applicable chart.,1480,imagery;infrastructure;location;map;Geospatial

Continuum of Care (COC) Areas,US Department of Housing and Urban Development,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/coc-areas,The purpose of the Continuum of Care (CoC) Homeless Assistance Programs is to reduce the incidence of homelessness in CoC communities by assisting homeless individuals and families in quickly transitioning to self-sufficiency and permanent housing. The programs administered by HUD award funds competitively and require the development of a Continuum of Care system in the community where assistance is being sought. A continuum of care system is designed to address the critical problem of homelessness through a coordinated community-based process of identifying needs and building a system to address those needs. The approach is predicated on the understanding that homelessness is not caused merely by a lack of shelter  but involves a variety of underlying  unmet needs - physical  economic  and social. Funds are granted based on the competition following the Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA).,33,2010;CoC;Continuum of Care;Puerto Rico;United States;boundaries;homeless assistance program;homelessness;housing;polygon;population;society

Results on earlier exams from 2006-2012 can be found at this link: http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/exeres/05289E74-2D81-4CC0-81F6-E1143E28F4C4 frameless.htm  Results presented here include all students who sat for either the Math or ELA exam. On the NYSED website  results for "matched" students can be found. To account for participation changes across years and anticipate the importance of year-to-year same-cohort comparisons for the Class of 2022  "matched" Math and ELA results were calculated to include 4th grade students who were tested in both the current and previous year and to include 5th – 8th grade students who were tested in all three years.  In order to comply with FERPA regulations on public reporting of education outcomes  rows with 5 or fewer students are suppressed.  For 2013  District 75 students are represented in their home districts and boroughs. For 2014 & 2015  they are not included.  Charter schools are not included. School level charter data can be found here: http://schools.nyc.gov/Accountability/data/TestResults/ELAandMathTestResults  In 2007  the New York State Education Department updated its testing policy for English Language Learners: ELLs in an English Language School System for more than one year are required to take the ELA exam. Previously  ELLs in an English Language School System for less than 3 years were exempt from taking the ELA exam.   Former English Language Learners includes any students who were classified as English Language Learners in at least one of the previous two school years.   A change in State testing policy drove a decrease in eighth grade proficiency rates in 2014 and 2015: to reduce double testing  most students in accelerated math courses who took the Algebra Regents exam were exempt from taking the 7th and 8th grade State math assessment. The numbers on the "All - with Math Regents" tab represent  the equivalent proficiency had the accelerated math students in 7th and 8th grade taken the State math assessment.

Dietary Supplement Ingredient Database,Agricultural Research Service  Department of Agriculture,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/dietary-supplement-ingredient-database,The Dietary Supplement Ingredient Database (DSID) is a collaborative venture with the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements  the US Department of Agriculture and other federal agencies to provide analytically-derived estimates of ingredients in dietary supplements. Release 2 of the DSID reports national estimates for vitamins and minerals in adult and children's multivitamins (MVMs) ( https://dsid.usda.nih.gov).  For the DSID studies  representative supplement products are identified  sampled and analyzed by experienced laboratories. In order to obtain accurate results  a quality assurance and quality control plan are established for each study  with standard reference materials  in-house control materials and product duplicate results assessed before product data are accepted as final.  Laboratory data are then statistically evaluated by ingredient and weighted by market share information  if available. For the MVM studies released in DSID-2  data are reported by ingredient across a range of labeled levels.  Results are predicted by regression and estimate mean percent differences from label and standard errors at these labeled levels. These data can be used by researchers to more accurately quantify nutrient intake from dietary supplements.,53,dietary supplement;multivitamin;nutrient composition of foods;nutrition;vitamin

Assisted Housing - Housing Choice Vouchers by Tract - National Geospatial Data Asset (NGDA),US Department of Housing and Urban Development,http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/assisted-housing-housing-choice-vouchers-by-tract,The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Developments (HUD) Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCVP) is the federal government's major program for assisting very low-income families  the elderly  and the disabled with decent  safe  sanitary and affordable housing in the private market. Since housing assistance is provided on behalf of the family or individual  participants are able to find their own housing  including single-family homes  townhouses and apartments. The participant is free to choose any housing that meets the requirements of the program and is not limited to units located in subsidized housing projects. Housing choice vouchers (HCV) are administered locally by public housing agencies (PHAs). The PHAs receive federal funds from HUD to administer the voucher program. A family that is issued a housing voucher is responsible for finding a suitable housing unit where the owner agrees to rent under the program. This unit may include the family's present residence. Rental units must meet minimum standards of health and safety  as determined by the PHA. A housing subsidy is paid to the landlord directly by the PHA on behalf of the participating family. The family then pays the difference between the actual rent charged by the landlord and the amount subsidized by the program. Under certain circumstances  if authorized by the PHA  a family may use its voucher to purchase a modest home.HCV locations are identified in public records by the owner and not the tenant so access to this information is restricted to help safeguard the location of HCV units. Due to the sensitive nature of the HCV locations  these are aggregated to the U.S. Census Bureaus census tract geography.,107,2010 Census Tracts;2012;HCV;NDGA;NGDA Portfolio Themes;National Geospatial Data Asset;Puerto Rico;Real Property Theme;Section 8;United States;assisted housing;boundaries;census;housing;housing choice vouchers;polygon;society
