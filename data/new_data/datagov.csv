11,,"U.S. Geological Survey, Department of the Interior",,,This is a tiled collection of the 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) and is one meter resolution.The 3DEP data holdings serve as the elevation layer of The National Map and provide foundational elevation information for earth science studies and mapping applications in the United States. Scientists and resource managers use 3DEP data for hydrologic modeling resource monitoring mapping and visualization and many other applications. The elevations in this DEM represent the topographic bare-earth surface. USGS standard one-meter DEMs are produced exclusively from high resolution light detection and ranging (lidar) source data of one-meter or higher resolution. One-meter DEM surfaces are seamless within collection projects but not necessarily seamless across projects. The spatial reference used for tiles of the one-meter DEM within the conterminous United States (CONUS) is Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) in units of meters and in conformance with the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). All bare earth elevation values are in meters and are referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88). Each tile is distributed in the UTM Zone in which it lies. If a tile crosses two UTM zones it is delivered in both zones. The one-meter DEM is the highest resolution standard DEM offered in the 3DEP product suite. Other 3DEP products are nationally seamless DEMs in resolutions of 1/3 1 and 2 arc seconds. These seamless DEMs were referred to as the National Elevation Dataset (NED) from about 2000 through 2015 at which time they became the seamless DEM layers under the 3DEP program and the NED name and system were retired. Other 3DEP products include five-meter DEMs in Alaska as well as various source datasets including the lidar point cloud and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (Ifsar) digital surface models and intensity images.

Information is provided on the use        of illicit drugs alcohol and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as        lifetime annual and past-month usage for the following drug classes marijuana cocaine (and crack) hallucinogens heroin inhalants alcohol tobacco        and nonmedical use of prescription drugs including pain relievers tranquilizers stimulants and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment        history and perceived need for treatment and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic        criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were        also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts health care access and coverage illegal activities and arrest record problems resulting        from the use of drugs and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2015 survey including questions asked        only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These ""youth experiences"" items covered a variety of topics such as neighborhood environment illegal activities drug        use by friends social support extracurricular activities exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs and perceived adult attitudes        toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on        mental health and access to care perceived risk of using drugs perceived availability of drugs driving and personal behavior and cigar smoking.        Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey.

This dataset includes 2013 2014 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5) health outcomes (13) and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Division of Population Health Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2013 2014) Census Bureau 2010 census population data and American Community Survey (ACS) 2009-2013 2010-2014 estimates.

Data are derived from an investigation by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner which includes the toxicity report death certificate as well as a scene investigation.  The “Morphine (Not Heroin)” values are related to the differences between how Morphine and Heroin are metabolized and therefor detected in the toxicity results. Heroin metabolizes to 6-MAM which then metabolizes to morphine.  6-MAM is unique to heroin and has a short half-life (as does heroin itself). Thus in some heroin deaths the toxicity results will not indicate whether the morphine is from heroin or prescription morphine. In these cases the Medical Examiner may be able to determine the cause based on the scene investigation (such as  finding heroin needles). If they find prescription morphine at the scene it is certified as “Morphine (not heroin).”  Therefor the Cause of Death may indicate Morphine but the Heroin or Morphine (Not Heroin) may not be indicated.   “Any Opioid” – If the Medical Examiner cannot conclude whether it’s RX Morphine or heroin based morphine in the toxicity results that column may be checked",CSV,,"[death, drug, heroin, opioid, overdose, substance-abuse]",No license information was provided.,,,311,311,,,Accidental Drug Related Deaths  2012-June 2017,2017-11-06,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/accidental-drug-related-deaths-january-2012-sept-2015

The MTDB represents                   a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts however each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data                   set or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.             ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are approximate area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas that the Census Bureau            creates to present statistical data for each decennial census. The Census Bureau delineates ZCTA boundaries for the United States Puerto Rico American            Samoa Guam the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands once each decade following the decennial census. Data users            should not use ZCTAs to identify the official USPS ZIP Code for mail delivery. The USPS makes periodic changes to ZIP Codes to support more efficient            mail delivery.             The Census Bureau uses tabulation blocks as the basis for defining each ZCTA. Tabulation blocks are assigned to a ZCTA based on the most frequently            occurring ZIP Code for the addresses contained within that block. The most frequently occurring ZIP Code also becomes the five-digit numeric code of the            ZCTA. These codes may contain leading zeros.             Blocks that do not contain addresses but are surrounded by a single ZCTA (enclaves) are assigned to the surrounding ZCTA. Because the Census Bureau only            uses the most frequently occurring ZIP Code to assign blocks a ZCTA may not exist for every USPS ZIP Code. Some ZIP Codes may not have a matching ZCTA            because too few addresses were associated with the specific ZIP Code or the ZIP Code was not the most frequently occurring ZIP Code within any of the            blocks where it exists.

The file includes the following population items sex age race Hispanic or Latino origin household relationship and household and family characteristics. Housing items include occupancy status and tenure (whether the unit is owner or renter occupied). SF1 does not include information on incomes poverty status overcrowded housing or age of housing. These topics will be covered in Summary File 3. Data are available for states counties county subdivisions places census tracts block groups and where applicable American Indian and Alaskan Native Areas and Hawaiian Home Lands. The SF1 data are available on the Bureau's web site and may be retrieved from American FactFinder as tables lists or maps. Users may also download a set of compressed ASCII files for each state via the Bureau's FTP server. There are over 8000 data items available for each geographic area. The full listing of these data items is available here as a downloadable compressed data base file named TABLES.ZIP. The uncompressed is in FoxPro data base file (dbf) format and may be imported to ACCESS EXCEL and other software formats. While all of this information is useful the Office of Community Planning and Development has downloaded selected information for all states and areas and is making this information available on the CPD web pages. The tables and data items selected are those items used in the CDBG and HOME allocation formulas plus topics most pertinent to the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) the Consolidated Plan and similar overall economic and community development plans. The information is contained in five compressed (zipped) dbf tables for each state. When uncompressed the tables are ready for use with FoxPro and they can be imported into ACCESS EXCEL and other spreadsheet GIS and database software. The data are at the block group summary level. The first two characters of the file name are the state abbreviation. The next two letters are BG for block group. Each record is labeled with the code and name of the city and county in which it is located so that the data can be summarized to higher-level geography. The last part of the file name describes the contents . The GEO file contains standard Census Bureau geographic identifiers for each block group such as the metropolitan area code and congressional district code. The only data included in this table is total population and total housing units. POP1 and POP2 contain selected population variables and selected housing items are in the HU file.

PAD-US is an ongoing project with several published versions of a spatial database of areas dedicated to the preservation of biological diversity and other natural recreational or cultural uses managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The geodatabase maps and describes public open space and other protected areas. Most areas are public lands owned in fee; however long-term easements leases and agreements or administrative designations documented in agency management plans may be included. The PAD-US database strives to be a complete “best available” inventory of protected areas (lands and waters) including data provided by managing agencies and organizations. The dataset is built in collaboration with several partners and data providers (http//gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/stewards/). See Supplemental Information Section of this metadata record for more information on partnerships and links to major partner organizations. As this dataset is a compilation of many data sets; data completeness accuracy and scale may vary. Federal and state data are generally complete while local government and private protected area coverage is about 50% complete and depends on data management capacity in the state. For completeness estimates by state http//www.protectedlands.net/partners. As the federal and state data are reasonably complete; focus is shifting to completing the inventory of local gov and voluntarily provided private protected areas. The PAD-US geodatabase contains over twenty-five attributes and four feature classes to support data management queries web mapping services and analyses Marine Protected Areas (MPA) Fee Easements and Combined. The data contained in the MPA Feature class are provided directly by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Marine Protected Areas Center (MPA http//marineprotectedareas.noaa.gov ) tracking the National Marine Protected Areas System. The Easements feature class contains data provided directly from the National Conservation Easement Database (NCED http//conservationeasement.us ) The MPA and Easement feature classes contain some attributes unique to the sole source databases tracking them (e.g. Easement Holder Name from NCED Protection Level from NOAA MPA Inventory). The ""Combined"" feature class integrates all fee easement and MPA features as the best available national inventory of protected areas in the standard PAD-US framework. In addition to geographic boundaries PAD-US describes the protection mechanism category (e.g. fee easement designation other) owner and managing agency designation type unit name area public access and state name in a suite of standardized fields. An informative set of references (i.e. Aggregator Source GIS Source GIS Source Date) and ""local"" or source data fields provide a transparent link between standardized PAD-US fields and information from authoritative data sources. The areas in PAD-US are also assigned conservation measures that assess management intent to permanently protect biological diversity the nationally relevant ""GAP Status Code"" and global ""IUCN Category"" standard. A wealth of attributes facilitates a wide variety of data analyses and creates a context for data to be used at local regional state national and international scales. More information about specific updates and changes to this PAD-US version can be found in the Data Quality Information section of this metadata record as well as on the PAD-US website http//gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/data/history/.) Due to the completeness and complexity of these data it is highly recommended to review the Supplemental Information Section of the metadata record as well as the Data Use Constraints to better understand data partnerships as well as see tips and ideas of appropriate uses of the data and how to parse out the data that you are looking for.

168,,Allegheny County / City of Pittsburgh / Western PA Regional Data Center,,,In Pittsburgh Autonomous Vehicle (AV) companies have been testing autonomous vehicles since September 2016. However the tech is new and there have been some high-profile behavior that we believe warrants a larger conversation. So in early 2017 we set out to design a survey to see both how BikePGH donor-members and Pittsburgh residents at large feel about about sharing the road with AVs as a bicyclist and/or as a pedestrian. Our survey asked participants how they feel about being a fellow road user with AVs either walking or biking. We also wanted to collect stories about people’s experiences interacting with this nascent technology. We are unaware of any public surveys about people’s feelings or understanding of this new technology.    We hope that our results will help add to the body of data and help the public and politicians understand the complexity of possible futures that different economic models AV technology can bring to our cities and towncenters.    We conducted our survey in two parts. First we launched the survey exclusively to donor-members yielding 321 responses (out of 2900) via email. Once we closed the survey we launched it again but allowed the general public to take it. Through promoting it on our website social media channels and a few news articles we yielded 798 responses (mostly from people in the Pittsburgh region) for a combined total of 1119 responses.,CSV,,"[accident, argo, auto, automobile, autonomous-vehicle, av, avs, bicycle, bicyclists, bike, bike-lane, bikepgh, car, crash, crosswalk, ford, pedestrian, pittsburgh, public-safety, robot, robots, safety, self-driving-car, share-the-road, sidewalk, streets, survey, taxi, tech, technology, transportation, uber, waymo]",See this page for license information.,,,95,95,,,"Autonomous Vehicle Survey of Bicyclists and Pedestrians in Pittsburgh, 2017",2017-05-02T15:51:55.135127,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/autonomous-vehicle-survey-of-bicyclists-and-pedestrians-in-pittsburgh-2017

The comprehensive U.S. Climate Normals dataset includes various derived products including daily air temperature normals (including maximum and minimum temperature normal heating and cooling degree day normal and others) precipitation normals (including snowfall and snow depth percentiles frequencies and other) and hourly normals (all normal derived from hourly data including temperature dew point heat index wind chill wind cloudiness heating and cooling degree hours pressure normals). In addition to the standard set of normals users also can find ""agricultural normals"" which are used in many industries including but not limited to construction architecture pest control etc. These supplemental ""agricultural normals"" include frost-freeze date probabilities growing degree day normals probabilities of reaching minimum temperature thresholds and growing season length normals. Users can access the data either by product or by station. Included in the dataset is extensive documentation to describe station metadata filename descriptions and methodology of producing the data. All data utilized in the computation of the 1981-2010 Climate Normals were taken from the ISD Lite (a subset of derived Integrated Surface Data) the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily dataset and standardized monthly temperature data (COOP). These source datasets (including intermediate datasets used in the computation of products) are also archived at the NOAA NCDC.",HTML,,"[atmosphere, united states of am..., freeze, north america, national centers fo..., nesdis, noaa, u.s. department of ..., doc/noaa/nesdis/ncei, agriculture, continent, earth science, vertical location, v : point resolution, doc/noaa/nesdis/ncdc, land surface, maximum/minimum tem..., virgin islands, precipitation amount, atmospheric tempera..., puerto rico, degree days, thermometers, temperature anomalies, liquid precipitation, national climatic d..., nesdis, noaa, u.s. department of ..., frost, rain, precipitation, atmospheric phenomena, h : point resolution, surface temperature, rain gauges, precipitation anoma..., meteorological stat...]",U.S. Government Work,,,94,94,,,U.S. Monthly Climate Normals (1981-2010),,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-monthly-climate-normals-1981-2010

201,,State of Connecticut,,,This dataset contains data by school on student SAT scores relative to the SAT College and Career Readiness (CCR) Benchmark score of 1550 (critical reading mathematics and writing sections combined) for the graduating classes of 2012 and 2013.  According to research conducted by the College Board* a score of 1550 indicates that a student will have a 65 percent or greater likelihood of achieving a B- average or higher during the first year of college.  This dataset also provides an estimated SAT Participation Rate which equals the number of SAT test-taking seniors in the school divided by the number of seniors enrolled in the school as a percentage.  These participation rates are considered an estimate because the grade level of the SAT test-taker is self-reported by the student at the time of registration for the SAT while the total number of seniors enrolled in the school is reported to the Connecticut State Department of Education (CSDE) by the district. These are the best available estimates of SAT participation rates.  The Benchmark Performance reflect the results of only those who participate in the SAT.  Because participation rates vary from school to school the CSDE provides both the estimated Participation rates together with the Benchmark Performance in order to promote fair and valid comparisons across schools.   Note The data are suppressed when there are too few test-takers to sufficiently protect privacy.  *The research report can be found at    http//research.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/publications/2012/7/researchreport-2011-5-sat-college-readiness-benchmark-secondary-performance.pdf,CSV,,"[education, sat, school]",No license information was provided.,,,80,80,,,SAT School Participation and Performance: 2012-2013,2014-10-31,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/sat-school-participation-and-performance-2012-2013

203,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce",,,Global Surface Summary of the Day is derived from The Integrated Surface Hourly (ISH) dataset. The ISH dataset includes global data obtained from the USAF Climatology Center located in the Federal Climate Complex with NCDC. The latest daily summary data are normally available 1-2 days after the date-time of the observations used in the daily summaries. The online data files begin with 1929 and are at the time of this writing at the Version 8 software level. Over 9000 stations' data are typically available. The daily elements included in the dataset (as available from each station) are Mean temperature (.1 Fahrenheit) Mean dew point (.1 Fahrenheit) Mean sea level pressure (.1 mb) Mean station pressure (.1 mb) Mean visibility (.1 miles) Mean wind speed (.1 knots) Maximum sustained wind speed (.1 knots) Maximum wind gust (.1 knots) Maximum temperature (.1 Fahrenheit) Minimum temperature (.1 Fahrenheit) Precipitation amount (.01 inches) Snow depth (.1 inches) Indicator for occurrence of Fog Rain or Drizzle Snow or Ice Pellets Hail Thunder Tornado/Funnel Cloud Global summary of day data for 18 surface meteorological elements are derived from the synoptic/hourly observations contained in USAF DATSAV3 Surface data and Federal Climate Complex Integrated Surface Hourly (ISH). Historical data are generally available for 1929 to the present with data from 1973 to the present being the most complete. For some periods one or more countries' data may not be available due to data restrictions or communications problems. In deriving the summary of day data a minimum of 4 observations for the day must be present (allows for stations which report 4 synoptic observations/day). Since the data are converted to constant units (e.g knots) slight rounding error from the originally reported values may occur (e.g 9.9 instead of 10.0). The mean daily values described below are based on the hours of operation for the station. For some stations/countries the visibility will sometimes 'cluster' around a value (such as 10 miles) due to the practice of not reporting visibilities greater than certain distances. The daily extremes and totals--maximum wind gust precipitation amount and snow depth--will only appear if the station reports the data sufficiently to provide a valid value. Therefore these three elements will appear less frequently than other values. Also these elements are derived from the stations' reports during the day and may comprise a 24-hour period which includes a portion of the previous day. The data are reported and summarized based on Greenwich Mean Time (GMT 0000Z - 2359Z) since the original synoptic/hourly data are reported and based on GMT.,HTML,,"[atmosphere, cyclones, cryosphere, hail, sleet, national centers fo..., nesdis, noaa, u.s. department of ..., doc/noaa/nesdis/ncei, sea level pressure, earth science, tornadoes, air quality, vertical location, atmospheric pressure, doc/noaa/nesdis/ncdc, storms, snow, maximum/minimum tem..., fog, precipitation amount, atmospheric tempera..., terrestrial hydrosp..., freezing rain, liquid precipitation, atmospheric electri..., national climatic d..., nesdis, noaa, u.s. department of ..., visibility, surface winds, rain, geographic region, land surface, precipitation, atmospheric phenomena, dew point temperature, atmospheric winds, ice pellets, surface temperature, atmospheric pressur..., air temperature, lightning, snow depth, surface pressure, solid precipitation, snow/ice, global land]",U.S. Government Work,,,80,80,,,Global Surface Summary of the Day - GSOD,,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/global-surface-summary-of-the-day-gsod

The surveys are designed to provide quarterly as well as annual estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs alcohol and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime annual and past-month usage for the following drug classes marijuana cocaine (and crack) hallucinogens heroin inhalants alcohol tobacco and nonmedical use of prescription drugs including pain relievers tranquilizers stimulants and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts health care access and coverage illegal activities and arrest record problems resulting from the use of drugs and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2014 survey including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These ""youth experiences"" items covered a variety of topics such as neighborhood environment illegal activities drug use by friends social support extracurricular activities exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and access to care perceived risk of using drugs perceived availability of drugs driving and personal behavior and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008 a split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems.

222,,U.S. Department of Health & Human Services,,,This dataset describes drug poisoning deaths at the U.S. and state level by selected demographic characteristics and includes age-adjusted death rates for drug poisoning. Deaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision (ICDâ10). Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICDâ10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40âX44 (unintentional) X60âX64 (suicide) X85 (homicide) or Y10âY14 (undetermined intent).    Estimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files. Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011â2015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published. Death rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICDâ10 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99 âOther ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality.â For example this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states.

A primary goal of the MRLC Consortium is to generate current consistent and seamless national datasets of land cover percent developed imperviousness and percent tree canopy. NLCD 2001 Percent Tree Canopy was developed in three key steps 1. Reference data of tree canopy density was derived from the high spatial resolution images. 2. Density prediction models were calibrated using reference data and Landsat spectral bands. 3. The models developed in step 2 were extrapolated spatially to map per-pixel tree canopy density. This method is described in detail in Huang et al. (2001).

233,,"U.S. Geological Survey, Department of the Interior",,,"The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) from The National Map (TNM) defines the perimeter of drainage areas formed by the terrain and other landscape characteristics. The drainage areas are nested within each other so that a large drainage area such as the Upper Mississippi River will be composed of multiple smaller drainage areas such as the Wisconsin River. Each of these smaller areas can further be subdivided into smaller and smaller drainage areas. The WBD uses six different levels in this hierarchy with the smallest averaging about 30000 acres. The WBD is made up of polygons nested into six levels of data respectively defined by Regions Subregions Basins Subbasins Watersheds and Subwatersheds. For additional information on the WBD go to https//nhd.usgs.gov/wbd.html. The USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) service is a companion dataset to the WBD. The NHD is a comprehensive set of digital spatial data that encodes information about naturally occurring and constructed bodies of surface water (lakes ponds and reservoirs) paths through which water flows (canals ditches streams and rivers) and related entities such as point features (springs wells stream gages and dams). The information encoded about these features includes classification and other characteristics delineation geographic name position and related measures a ""reach code"" through which other information can be related to the NHD and the direction of water flow. The network of reach codes delineating water and transported material flow allows users to trace movement in upstream and downstream directions. In addition to this geographic information the dataset contains metadata that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements to the data. The NHD is available nationwide in two seamless datasets one based on 124000-scale maps and referred to as high resolution NHD and the other based on 1100000-scale maps and referred to as medium resolution NHD. Additional selected areas in the United States are available based on larger scales such as 15000-scale or greater and referred to as local resolution NHD. For more information on the NHD go to https//nhd.usgs.gov/index.html.

236,,Department of the Interior,,,Several bureaus within the Department of Interior compiled available information from seabird observation datasets from the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf into a single database with the goal of conducting research and informing coastal and offshore planning activities. The cooperators were the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's (BOEM) Environmental Studies Program (http//www.boem.gov/Environmental-Stewardship/Environmental-Studies/Environmental-Studies.aspx) the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (USFWS) Division of Migratory Bird Management (http//www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/) and the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Patuxent Wildlife Research Center (http//www.pwrc.usgs.gov). The resulting product is the Atlantic Offshore Seabird Dataset Catalog which characterizes the survey effort and bird observations that have been collected across space and time. Currently the database contains ~60 datasets from 1906-2009 with over 260000 records of seabird observations. Data will initially be provided as summary web mapping services with web feature services (for downloading and looking at single-species data) at the linkage given elsewhere in this document. USAGE Seabirds provide unique challenges even when using estimation techniques to sample populations (e.g. Tasker et al. 1984 Spear et al. 1992). To date there has been little consistency among survey designs. Surveys have varied by the type of vessel from which they are conducted (ship plane) the methodology that counts are made the width of the area being counted and equipment used among many other differences. Under such circumstances comparing results and making inferences can be difficult. Because these estimates of effort-adjusted counts do not account for detection probability they are likely biased by factors that affect this parameter such as weather survey method observer or other environmental variables (MacKenzie et al. 2006). Such results may be considered naïve in that they do not account for factors that can affect the ability to detect an animal. Furthermore these results contain data collected over a 30 year period without regard for any long term temporal changes that may have occurred with species or the environment. Further analysis is necessary to determine if such changes have occurred with any species. While it is possible to separate data collected recently from historical (>20 years old) datasets the amount of recent data is limited and therefore maps showing only these data may be limited spatially. Finally effort calculations do not account for survey width while normally static during a survey can be reduced during certain conditions and does vary by survey method especially boat vs. plan surveys. The vast majority of survey data collected offshore U.S. Atlantic waters were collected using similar techniques and so effort data will not be greatly affected by such discrepancies. Still such differences do exist and were not accounted for; therefore this estimate of survey effort is a rough surrogate for effort. Consequently the effort-adjusted counts will also be affected by differences in survey methodology and should be considered only roughly offset by effort.,Esri REST,,"[atlantic outer cont..., rhode island, atlantic coast, maine, monitoring, new jersey, delaware, north carolina, new york, puerto rico, maryland, biology, virginia, connecticut, massachusetts, regulatory, modeling, marine, vermont, georgia, natural resources, pennsylvania, florida, new hampshire, south carolina]",No license information was provided.

250,,Department of Agriculture,,,This dataset consists of general soil association units. It was developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey and supersedes the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) dataset published in 1994. It consists of a broad based inventory of soils and non-soil areas that occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped of 1250000 in the continental U.S. Hawaii Puerto and the Virgin Islands and 11000000 in Alaska. The dataset was created by generalizing more detailed soil survey maps. Where more detailed soil survey maps were not available data on geology topography vegetation and climate were assembled together with Land Remote Sensing Satellite (LANDSAT) images. Soils of like areas were studied and the probable classification and extent of the soils were determined.  Map unit composition was determined by transecting or sampling areas on the more detailed maps and expanding the data statistically to characterize the entire map unit.  This dataset consists of georeferenced vector digital data and tabular digital data. The map data were collected in 1- by 2-degree topographic quadrangle units and merged into a seamless national dataset. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information system relational database which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.  These data provide information about soil features on or near the surface of the Earth. Data were collected as part of the National Cooperative Soil Survey. These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the state regional and national level.

This standard publication guideline for cadastral data and is intended to provide a common format structure and content of the information and allow it to be readily used across jurisdictional boundaries. This data represents the GIS Version of the Public Land Survey System including both rectangular and non-rectangular survey data. The rectangular survey data are a reference system for land tenure based upon meridian township/range section section subdivision and government lots. The non-retangular survey data represent surveys that were largely performed to protect and/or convey title on specific parcels of land such as minerals surveys and tracts. The data are largely complete in reference to the rectangular survey data at the level of first division. However the data varies in terms of granularity of its spatial representation as well as its content below the first division. Therefore depending upon the data source and steward accurate subdivision of the rectangular data may not be available below the first division and the non-rectangular minerals surveys may not be present. At times the complexity of surveys rendered the collection of data cost prohibitive such as in areas characterized by numerous overlapping mineral surveys. In these situations the data were often not abstracted or were only partially abstracted and incorporated into the data set. These PLSS data were compiled from a broad spectrum or sources including federal county and private survey records such as field notes and plats as well as map sources such as USGS 7 ½ minute quadrangles.

313,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce",,,This dataset consists of Level II weather radar data collected from Next-Generation Radar (NEXRAD) stations located in the contiguous United States Alaska Hawaii U.S. territories and at military base sites. NEXRAD is a network of 160 high-resolution Doppler weather radars operated by the NOAA National Weather Service (NWS) the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the U.S. Air Force (USAF). Doppler radars detect atmospheric precipitation and winds which allow scientists to track and anticipate weather events such as rain ice pellets snow hail and tornadoes as well as some non-weather objects like birds and insects. NEXRAD stations use the Weather Surveillance Radar - 1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) system. This is a 10 cm wavelength (S-Band) radar that operates at a frequency between 2700 and 3000 MHz. The radar system operates in two basic modes a slow-scanning Clear Air Mode (Mode B) for analyzing air movements when there is little or no precipitation activity in the area and a Precipitation Mode (Mode A) with a faster scan for tracking active weather. The two modes employ nine Volume Coverage Patterns (VCPs) to adequately sample the atmosphere based on weather conditions. A VCP is a series of 360 degree sweeps of the antenna at pre-determined elevation angles and pulse repetition frequencies completed in a specified period of time. The radar scan times 4.5 5 6 or 10 minutes depending on the selected VCP. The NEXRAD products are divided into multiple data processing levels. The lower Level II data contain the three meteorological base data quantities at original resolution reflectivity mean radial velocity and spectrum width. With the advent of dual polarization beginning in 2011 additional base products of differential reflectivity correlation coefficient and differential phase are available. Level II data are recorded at all NWS and most USAF and FAA WSR-88D sites. From the Level II quantities computer processing generates numerous meteorological analysis Level 3 products. NEXRAD data are acquired by the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) for archiving and dissemination to users. Data coverage varies by station and ranges from June 1991 to 1 day from present.

345,,U.S. Department of Health & Human Services,,,This dataset describes drug poisoning deaths at the U.S. and state level by selected demographic characteristics and includes age-adjusted death rates for drug poisoning from 1999 to 2015.    Deaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision (ICDâ10). Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICDâ10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40âX44 (unintentional) X60âX64 (suicide) X85 (homicide) or Y10âY14 (undetermined intent).    Estimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011â2015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.    Estimate does not meet standards of reliability or precision. Death rates are flagged as âUnreliableâ in the chart when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less.    Death rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICDâ10 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99 âOther ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortalityâ (2). For example this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Estimates should be interpreted with caution.    Smoothed county age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100000 population) were obtained according to methods described elsewhere (3â5). Briefly two-stage hierarchical models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning for each year during 1999â2015. These annual county-level estimates âborrow strengthâ across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (35). Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County Colo. and Denali County Alaska before 2003 (67). Additionally Bedford City Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015.

351,,Department of the Interior,,,"This data set represents the extent approximate location and type of wetlands and deepwater habitats in the United States and its Territories. These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). The National Wetlands Inventory - Version 2 Surface Waters and Wetlands Inventory was derived by retaining the wetland and deepwater polygons that compose the NWI digital wetlands spatial data layer and reintroducing any linear wetland or surface water features that were orphaned from the original NWI hard copy maps by converting them to narrow polygonal features. Additionally the data are supplemented with hydrography data buffered to become polygonal features as a secondary source for any single-line stream features not mapped by the NWI and to complete segmented connections. Wetland mapping conducted in WA OR CA NV and ID after 2012 and most other projects mapped after 2015 were mapped to include all surface water features and are not derived data. The linear hydrography dataset used to derive Version 2 was the U.S. Geological Survey's National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). Specific information on the NHD version used to derive Version 2 and where Version 2 was mapped can be found in the 'comments' field of the Wetlands_Project_Metadata feature class. Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats because of their depth go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy the Service also excludes certain types of ""farmed wetlands"" as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition.

362,,Federal Geographic Data Committee,,,The SMA implementation is comprised of one feature dataset with several polygon feature classes rather than a single feature class. SurfaceManagementAgency The Surface Management Agency (SMA) Geographic Information System (GIS) dataset depicts Federal land for the United States and classifies this land by its active Federal surface managing agency. The SMA feature class covers the continental United States Alaska Hawaii Puerto Rico Guam American Samoa and the Virgin Islands. A Federal SMA agency refers to a Federal agency with administrative jurisdiction over the surface of Federal lands. Jurisdiction over the land is defined when the land is either Withdrawn by some administrative or legislative action or Acquired or Exchanged by a Federal Agency. This layer is a dynamic assembly of spatial data layers maintained at various federal and local government offices. The GIS data contained in this dataset represents the polygon features that show the boundaries for Surface Management Agency and the surface extent of each Federal agencyâs surface administrative jurisdiction. SMA data depicts current withdrawn areas for a particular agency and (when appropriate) includes land that was acquired or exchanged and is located outside of a withdrawal area for that agency. The SMA data do not illustrate land status ownership pattern boundaries or contain land ownership attribute details. SMA_Withdrawals The Surface Management Agency (SMA) Withdrawals Geographic Information System (GIS) dataset includes all of the known withdrawals which transfer surface jurisdictional responsibilities to federal agencies. The SMA Withdrawls feature class covers the continental United States Alaska Hawaii Puerto Rico Guam American Samoa and the Virgin Islands. A Federal SMA Withdrawal is defined by formal actions that set aside withhold or reserve Federal land by statute or administrative order for public purposes. A withdrawal creates a title encumbrance on the land. Withdrawals must accomplish one or more of the following A. Transfer total or partial jurisdiction of Federal land between Federal agencies. B. Close (segregate) Federal land to operation of all or some of the public land laws and/or mineral laws. C. Dedicate Federal land to a specific public purpose. There are four major categories of formal withdrawals (1) Administrative (2) Presidential Proclamations (3) Congressional and (4) Federal Power Act (FPA) or Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Withdrawals. These SMA Withdrawals will include the present total extent of withdrawn areas rather than all of the individual withdrawal actions that created them over time. These data do not illustrate land status ownership pattern boundaries or contain land ownership attribute details. SPP_WithdrawalAreas The Special Public Purpose (SPP) Withdrawals Geographic Information System (GIS) dataset includes all of the known SPP Withdrawal Areas which limit use or access to Federal lands (e.g. Wilderness National Monument). The Special Public Purpose Withdrawal Areas feature class covers the continental United States Alaska Hawaii Puerto Rico Guam American Samoa and the Virgin Islands.

364,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce",,,This dataset consists of Level 3 weather radar products collected from Next-Generation Radar (NEXRAD) stations located in the contiguous United States Alaska Hawaii U.S. territories and at military base sites. NEXRAD is a network of 160 high-resolution Doppler weather radars operated by the NOAA National Weather Service (NWS) the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the U.S. Air Force (USAF). Doppler radars detect atmospheric precipitation and winds which allow scientists to track and anticipate weather events such as rain ice pellets snow hail and tornadoes as well as some non-weather objects like birds and insects. NEXRAD stations use the Weather Surveillance Radar - 1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) system. This is a 10 cm wavelength (S-Band) radar that operates at a frequency between 2700 and 3000 MHz. The radar system operates in two basic modes a slow-scanning Clear Air Mode (Mode B) for analyzing air movements when there is little or no precipitation activity in the area and a Precipitation Mode (Mode A) with a faster scan for tracking active weather. The two modes employ nine Volume Coverage Patterns (VCPs) to adequately sample the atmosphere based on weather conditions. A VCP is a series of 360 degree sweeps of the antenna at pre-determined elevation angles and pulse repetition frequencies completed in a specified period of time. The radar scan times 4.5 5 6 or 10 minutes depending on the selected VCP. During 2008 the WSR-88D radars were upgraded to produce increased spatial resolution data called Super Resolution. The earlier Legacy Resolution data provides radar reflectivity at 1.0 degree azimuthal by 1 km range gate resolution to a range of 460 km and Doppler velocity and spectrum width at 1.0 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 230 km. The upgraded Super Resolution data provides radar reflectivity at 0.5 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 460 km and Doppler velocity and spectrum width at 0.5 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 300 km. Super resolution makes a compromise of slightly decreased noise reduction for a large gain in resolution. In 2010 the deployment of the Dual Polarization (Dual Pol) capability to NEXRAD sites began with the first operational Dual Pol radar in May 2011. Dual Pol radar capability adds vertical polarization to the previous horizontal radar waves in order to more accurately discern the return signal. This allows the radar to better distinguish between types of precipitation (e.g. rain hail and snow) improves rainfall estimates improves data retrieval in mountainous terrain and aids in removal of non-weather artifacts. The NEXRAD products are divided in two data processing levels. The lower Level 2 data are base products at original resolution. Level 2 data are recorded at all NWS and most USAF and FAA WSR-88D sites. From the Level 2 quantities computer processing generates numerous meteorological analysis Level 3 products. The Level 3 data consists of reduced resolution low-bandwidth base products as well as many derived post-processed products. Level 3 products are recorded at most U.S. sites though non-US sites do not have Level 3 products. There are over 40 Level 3 products available from the NCDC. General products for Level 3 include the base and composite reflectivity storm relative velocity vertical integrated liquid echo tops and VAD wind profile. Precipitation products for Level 3 include estimated ground accumulated rainfall amounts for one and three hour periods storm totals and digital arrays. Estimates are based on reflectivity to rainfall rate (Z-R) relationships. Overlay products for Level 3 are alphanumeric data that give detailed information on certain parameters for an identified storm cell. These include storm structure hail index mesocyclone identification tornadic vortex signature and storm tracking information. Radar messages for Level 3 are sent by the radar site to users in order to know more about the radar status and special product data. NEXRAD data are provided to the NOAA National Climatic Data Center for archiving and dissemination to users. Data coverage varies by station and ranges from May 1992 to 1 day from present.

SSURGO is generally the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) in accordance with NCSS mapping standards. The tabular data represent the soil attributes and are derived from properties and characteristics stored in the National Soil Information System (NASIS). The gSSURGO data were prepared by merging traditional SSURGO digital vector map and tabular data into a Conterminous US-wide extent and adding a Conterminous US-wide gridded map layer derived from the vector plus a new value added look up (valu) table containing ""ready to map"" attributes. The gridded map layer is offered in an ArcGIS file geodatabase raster format.   The raster and vector map data have a Conterminous US-wide extent. The raster map data have a 10 meter cell size that approximates the vector polygons in an Albers Equal Area projection. Each cell (and polygon) is linked to a map unit identifier called the map unit key. A unique map unit key is used to link to raster cells and polygons to attribute tables including the new value added look up (valu) table that contains additional derived data.  The value added look up (valu) table contains attribute data summarized to the map unit level using best practice generalization methods intended to meet the needs of most users. The generalization methods include map unit component weighted averages and percent of the map unit meeting a given criteria.  The Gridded SSURGO dataset was created for use in national regional and state-wide resource planning and analysis of soils data.

398,,Department of Energy,,,"Open PV Project is a collaborative effort between government industry and the public that is compiling a comprehensive database of photovoltaic (PV) installation data for the United States. Data for the project are voluntarily contributed from a variety of sources including utilities installers and the general public. The data collected is actively maintained by the contributors and are always changing to provide an evolving up-to-date snapshot of the US solar power market. Data Collection. The Open PV Project is collecting data from any willing contributor of available information. NREL has ""seeded"" the Open PV database by requesting data from most state run incentive programs large utilities and other organizations. This initial data collection has provided a solid base of data for the project to launch from and it is our hope that the database will continue to grow through contributions from the PV community and anyone interested in understanding PV market dynamics in the US.  Data Quality. Determining the quality of incoming data is dependent upon who is submitting the data to the project. This means that data coming from users associated with a particular organization may be ""trusted"" more than data from other unknown users. Each registered user is assigned a default ""score"" based on their organizational affiliation. This score is highest for Government users (State Federal etc.) because such users are often involved with incentive programs that have a defined data collection process in place. Second are utility and PV installers (and others in the PV industry) and so on. All users who contribute data to the project have the ability to gain a ""project reputation"" that can impact the score of the data they contribute.  Validation.  Data validation occurs on each record in the database on a regular basis. The database is continually analyzed for corrupt records bad or invalid data and outliers such as an abnormal cost to watt ratio. Records found to contain questionable data are flagged and are dealt with on a case by case basis by a member of the Open PV Team.  Duplication.  Understanding duplication is one of the ways that individual records are validated. In a publicly contributed database it is imperative to anticipate the submission of duplicate records. When duplicate records are detected they are added to an install specific list of duplicates and the data provided are aggregated into ""summary records"" of their respective installs. Identifying duplicate records helps validate PV installs in the database. The more a PV installation is duplicated in the database the more trust the project places on the data for that installation.  Data Fields. Required Fields. The Open PV Project is designed to be able to store nearly any type of information pertaining to PV installations. In order to provide the primary statistics from the database we have identified 4 data fields that are required of each PV install added to the project. These four fields are  -  Date Installed (Completion date or interconnection date) -  Size/Capacity of the PV Installation (in kW DC) -  Location (Zipcode or Street Address) -  Total Installed Cost (in USD before incentives). Additional Fields. The four required fields listed above provide the Open PV Project with the base information needed to derive several key statistics on the US PV market including historical trends and regional comparisons. However the design of the Open PV database is capable of storing nearly any type of data associated with PV installation so the Open PV Team would like to encourage you to contribute any additional information you are comfortable sharing. This extra information can be extremely valuable for example data that contains information about who installed the PV installation can help to answer very useful questions about where certain installers are working. Information on module or inverter types can be useful in mapping efficiency and detailed financing information can be a key factor in understanding trends in overall installation cost. The Open PV Team strongly encourages you to contribute any data you feel comfortable providing especially data you would like to see visualized in our gallery someday.",HTML,,"[deployment-database, market-statistics, nrel, open-pv, photovoltaic, pv, renewable-energy, solar, solar-deployment, solar-energy, solar-panel]",Creative Commons Attribution,,,43,43,,,The Open PV Project,2013-11-25T23:56:43.724005,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/the-open-pv-project

These Tiger/Line segments are grouped into routes identified as character strings in the ROUTE_ID field in the hmroutes.dbf table. The route name appearing in the ROUTE_ID is assigned by FMCSA and is unique for each State [this sentence could be deleted - it doesn't add a lot to it].

Full FGDC metadata records for each layer may be found by clicking the layer name at the web service endpoint (http//gispub.epa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/OAR_OAQPS/NonattainmentAreas/MapServer) and viewing the layer description. These layers identify areas in the U.S. where air pollution levels have not met the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for criteria air pollutants and have been designated ""nonattainment” areas (NAA)"". The data are updated weekly from an OAQPS internal database. However that does not necessarily mean the data have changed. The EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) has set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six principal pollutants which are called ""criteria"" pollutants. Under provisions of the Clean Air Act which is intended to improve the quality of the air we breathe EPA is required to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six common air pollutants. These commonly found air pollutants (also known as ""criteria pollutants"") are found all over the United States. They are particle pollution (often referred to as particulate matter) ground-level ozone carbon monoxide sulfur oxides nitrogen oxides and lead. For each criteria pollutant there are specific procedures used for measuring ambient concentrations and for calculating long-term (quarterly or annual) and/or short-term (24-hour) exposure levels. The methods and allowable concentrations vary from one pollutant to another and within NAAQS revisions for each pollutant. These pollutants can harm your health and the environment and cause property damage. Of the six pollutants particle pollution and ground-level ozone are the most widespread health threats. EPA calls these pollutants ""criteria"" air pollutants because it regulates them by developing human health-based and/or environmentally-based criteria (science-based guidelines) for setting permissible levels. The set of limits based on human health is called primary standards. Another set of limits intended to prevent environmental and property damage is called secondary standards. A geographic area that meets or does better than the primary standard is called an attainment area; areas that don't meet the primary standard are called nonattainment areas. In some cases a designated nonattainment area can include portions of 2 3 or 4 states rather than falling entirely within a single state. Multi-state areas have had different state portions handled through up to 3 separate EPA regional offices. The actions of EPA and the state governments for separate portions of such areas are not always simultaneous. While some areas have had coordinated action from all related states on the same day other areas (so-called ""split areas"") have had delays of several months ranging up to more than 2 years between different states. EPA must designate areas as meeting (attainment) or not meeting (nonattainment) the standard. A designation is the term EPA uses to describe the air quality in a given area for any of the six common air pollutants (criteria pollutants). After EPA establishes or revises a primary and/or secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) the Clean Air Act requires EPA to designate areas as ""attainment"" (meeting) ""nonattainment"" (not meeting) or ""unclassifiable"" (insufficient data) after monitoring data is collected by state local and tribal governments. Once nonattainment designations take effect the state and local governments have three years to develop implementation plans outlining how areas will attain and maintain the standards by reducing air pollutant emissions. For further information please refer to http//www3.epa.gov/airquality/greenbook/index.html.

473,,Cornell University,,,This data set is a digital general soil association map developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey. It consists of a broad based inventory of soils and non soil areas that occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographic ally shown at the scale mapped. The soil maps for STATSGO are compiled by generalizing more detailed soil survey maps. Where more detailed soil survey maps are not available data on geology topography vegetation and climate are assembled together with Land Remote Sensing Satellite (LANDSAT) images. Soils of like areas are studied and the probable classification and extent of the soils are determined. Map unit composition for a STATSGO map is determined by transecting or sampling areas on the more detailed maps and expanding the data statistically to characterize the whole map unit. This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are collected in 1- by 2-degree topographic quadrangle units and merged and distributed as statewide coverages. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the Map Unit Interpretations Record relational data base which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.

488,,Department of the Interior,,,This dataset combines the work of several different projects to create a seamless data set for the contiguous United States. Data from four regional Gap Analysis Projects and the LANDFIRE project were combined to make this dataset. In the northwestern United States (Idaho Oregon Montana Washington and Wyoming) data in this map came from the Northwest Gap Analysis Project. In the southwestern United States (Colorado Arizona Nevada New Mexico and Utah) data used in this map came from the Southwest Gap Analysis Project. The data for Alabama Florida Georgia Kentucky North Carolina South Carolina Mississippi Tennessee and Virginia came from the Southeast Gap Analysis Project and the California data was generated by the updated California Gap land cover project. The Hawaii Gap Analysis project provided the data for Hawaii. In areas of the county (central U.S. Northeast Alaska) that have not yet been covered by a regional Gap Analysis Project data from the Landfire project was used. Similarities in the methods used by these projects made possible the combining of the data they derived into one seamless coverage. They all used multi-season satellite imagery (Landsat ETM+) from 1999-2001 in conjunction with digital elevation model (DEM) derived datasets (e.g. elevation landform) to model natural and semi-natural vegetation. Vegetation classes were drawn from NatureServe's Ecological System Classification (Comer et al. 2003) or classes developed by the Hawaii Gap project. Additionally all of the projects included land use classes that were employed to describe areas where natural vegetation has been altered. In many areas of the country these classes were derived from the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD). For the majority of classes and in most areas of the country a decision tree classifier was used to discriminate ecological system types. In some areas of the country more manual techniques were used to discriminate small patch systems and systems not distinguishable through topography. The data contains multiple levels of thematic detail. At the most detailed level natural vegetation is represented by NatureServe's Ecological System classification (or in Hawaii the Hawaii GAP classification). These most detailed classifications have been crosswalked to the five highest levels of the National Vegetation Classification (NVC) Class Subclass Formation Division and Macrogroup. This crosswalk allows users to display and analyze the data at different levels of thematic resolution. Developed areas or areas dominated by introduced species timber harvest or water are represented by other classes collectively refered to as land use classes; these land use classes occur at each of the thematic levels. Raster data in both ArcGIS Grid and ERDAS Imagine format is available for download at http//gis1.usgs.gov/csas/gap/viewer/land_cover/Map.aspx Six layer files are included in the download packages to assist the user in displaying the data at each of the Thematic levels in ArcGIS.

It provides access to datasets from state and federal agencies as well as educational and research institutions. OBIS-USA handles both specimen-based data and survey results. Survey data come from recovered archives and current research activities. The datasets document where and when species were observed or collected bringing together marine biogeographic data that are spatially taxonomically and temporally comprehensive. The public OBIS-USA site (http//www.usgs.gov/obis-usa) provides actual data contents as well as summary data about what is contained in each dataset to assist users in evaluating suitability for use. Current functionality allows the user to locate view and aggregate the datasets and FGDC compliant metadata as well as to view and search the taxonomic geographic and temporal extent. To promote data interoperability the data are available in accordance with the marine-focused implementation of the Darwin Core data standard. In addition to basic download functions (tab-delimited) OBIS-USA offers web services for query flexibility and a wide range of output formats such as kml NetCDF MATLAB json and graph or map output to enable diverse types of scientific and geospatial data use and analysis platforms and products. OBIS-USA's two web services (ERDDAP and GeoServer) enable integration of OBIS-USA biogeographic data with other data types such as seafloor geology physical oceanography water chemistry and climate data. The NOAA Environmental Research Division Data Access Program(ERRDDAP) enables users to query scientific data by flexible parameters and obtain output in many formats.

503,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce",,,This dataset consists of Level III weather radar products collected from Next-Generation Radar (NEXRAD) stations located in the contiguous United States Alaska Hawaii U.S. territories and at military base sites. NEXRAD is a network of 160 high-resolution Doppler weather radars operated by the NOAA National Weather Service (NWS) the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the U.S. Air Force (USAF). Doppler radars detect atmospheric precipitation and winds which allow scientists to track and anticipate weather events such as rain ice pellets snow hail and tornadoes as well as some non-weather objects like birds and insects. NEXRAD stations use the Weather Surveillance Radar - 1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) system. This is a 10 cm wavelength (S-Band) radar that operates at a frequency between 2700 and 3000 MHz. The radar system operates in two basic modes a slow-scanning Clear Air Mode (Mode B) for analyzing air movements when there is little or no precipitation activity in the area and a Precipitation Mode (Mode A) with a faster scan for tracking active weather. The two modes employ nine Volume Coverage Patterns (VCPs) to adequately sample the atmosphere based on weather conditions. A VCP is a series of 360 degree sweeps of the antenna at pre-determined elevation angles and pulse repetition frequencies completed in a specified period of time. The radar scan times 4.5 5 6 or 10 minutes depending on the selected VCP. During 2008 the WSR-88D radars were upgraded to produce increased spatial resolution data called Super Resolution. The earlier Legacy Resolution data provides radar reflectivity at 1.0 degree azimuthal by 1 km range gate resolution to a range of 460 km and Doppler velocity and spectrum width at 1.0 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 230 km. The upgraded Super Resolution data provides radar reflectivity at 0.5 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 460 km and Doppler velocity and spectrum width at 0.5 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 300 km. Super resolution makes a compromise of slightly decreased noise reduction for a large gain in resolution. In 2010 the deployment of the Dual Polarization (Dual Pol) capability to NEXRAD sites began with the first operational Dual Pol radar in May 2011. Dual Pol radar capability adds vertical polarization to the previous horizontal radar waves in order to more accurately discern the return signal. This allows the radar to better distinguish between types of precipitation (e.g. rain hail and snow) improves rainfall estimates improves data retrieval in mountainous terrain and aids in removal of non-weather artifacts. The NEXRAD products are divided in two data processing levels. The lower Level II data are base products at original resolution. Level II data are recorded at all NWS and most USAF and FAA WSR-88D sites. From the Level II quantities computer processing generates numerous meteorological analysis Level III products. The Level III data consists of reduced resolution low-bandwidth base products as well as many derived post-processed products. Level III products are recorded at most U.S. sites though non-US sites do not have Level III products. There are over 40 Level III products available from the NCDC. General products for Level III include the base and composite reflectivity storm relative velocity vertical integrated liquid echo tops and VAD wind profile. Precipitation products for Level III include estimated ground accumulated rainfall amounts for one and three hour periods storm totals and digital arrays. Estimates are based on reflectivity to rainfall rate (Z-R) relationships. Overlay products for Level III are alphanumeric data that give detailed information on certain parameters for an identified storm cell. These include storm structure hail index mesocyclone identification tornadic vortex signature and storm tracking information. Radar messages for Level III are sent by the radar site to users in order to know more about the radar status and special product data. NEXRAD data are provided to the NOAA National Climatic Data Center for archiving and dissemination to users. Data coverage varies by station and ranges from May 1992 to 1 day from present.

Deaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision (ICDâ10). Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICDâ10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40âX44 (unintentional) X60âX64 (suicide) X85 (homicide) or Y10âY14 (undetermined intent).    Estimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files. Smoothed county age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100000 population) were obtained by using two-stage hierarchical models to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning for each year. These annual county-level estimates âborrow strengthâ across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size. Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County Colo. and Denali County Alaska before 2003.

555,,Department of the Interior,,,The coastal vulnerability index (CVI)provides a preliminary overview at a National scale of the relative susceptibility of the Nation's coast to sea-level rise. This initial classification is based upon variables including geomorphology regional coastal slope tide range wave height relative sea-level rise and shoreline erosion and accretion rates. The combination of these variables and the association of these variables to each other furnish a broad overview of coastal regions where physical changes are likely to occur due to sea-level rise. To make this coastal vulnerability index data more accessible to the public and other agencies the USGS created this web service. This web service was created utilizing ESRI ArcServer. Vector layers were collected organized by the coastal regions of the U.S. U.S. Atlantic Pacific and Gulf of Mexico Coasts and symbology made consistent among similar data sets.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts however each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to                                     stand alone as an independent data set or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.                               Census tracts are small relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity and were defined by local                              participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program.  The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in                              situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate.  The primary purpose of                              census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous                              decennial censuses.  Census tracts generally have a population size between 1200 and 8000 people with an optimum size of 4000                              people.  When first delineated census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics economic                              status and living conditions.  The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.  Physical                              changes in street patterns caused by highway construction new development and so forth may require boundary revisions.  In addition                              census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline.  Census tract                              boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features.  They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or                              incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the                              governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.  State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in                              the standard census geographic hierarchy.  In a few rare instances a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas.  These                              noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves                              noncontiguous.  For the 2010 Census the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a                              majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized                               American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts                              that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park military                              installation or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained                              only water area no land area.,HTML,,"[polygon, u.s., state or equivalent..., census tract, united states, tract]",U.S. Government Work,,,31,31,,,"TIGER/Line Shapefile, 2016, Series Information for the Current Census Tract State-based Shapefile",,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/tiger-line-shapefile-2016-series-information-for-the-current-census-tract-state-based-shapefile
562,,Department of Energy,,,"Find alternative fueling stations near an address or ZIP code or along a route in the United States. Enter a state to see a station count.  ## Data Collection Methods ##  The data in the Alternative Fueling Station Locator are gathered and verified through a variety of methods. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) obtains information about new stations from trade media Clean Cities coordinators an Add a Station form on the Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC) website and through collaborating with infrastructure equipment and fuel providers.  NREL regularly compares its station data with those of other relevant trade organizations and websites. Differences in methodologies and inclusion criteria may result in slight differences between NREL's database and those maintained by other organizations. NREL also collaborates with alternative fuel industry groups to maintain the data. NREL and its data collection subcontractor are currently collaborating with natural gas electric drive biodiesel ethanol and propane industry groups to establish best practices for identifying new stations in the most-timely manner possible and to develop a more rigorous network for the future.  ## Station Update Schedule ##  Existing stations in the database are contacted at least once a year on an established schedule to verify they are still operational and dispensing the fuel specified. Based on an established data collection schedule the database is updated once a month with the exception of electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) data which are updated twice a month. Stations that are no longer operational or no longer provide alternative fuel are removed from the database on a monthly basis or as they are identified.  ## Mapping and Counting Methods ##  Each point on the map is counted as one station in the station count. A station appears as one point on the map regardless of the number of fuel dispensers or charging outlets at that location. Station addresses are geocoded and mapped using an automatic geocoding application. The geocoding application returns the most accurate location based on the provided address. Station locations may also be provided by external sources (e.g. station operators) and/or verified in a geographic information system (GIS) tool like Google Earth Google Maps or Google StreetView. This information is considered highly accurate and these coordinates override any information generated using the geocoding application.  ## Notes about Specific Station Types ## ### Private Stations ### Stations with an Access of ""Private - Fleet customers only"" may allow other entities to fuel through a business-to-business arrangement. For more information fleet customers should refer to the information listed in the details section for that station to contact the station directly.  ### Biodiesel Stations ### The Alternative Fueling Station Locator only includes stations offering biodiesel blends of 20% (B20) and above.  ### Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) ### An electric charging station or EVSE appears as one point on the map regardless of the number of charging outlets at that location. The number and type of charging outlets available are displayed as additional details when the station location is selected. Each point on the map is counted as one station in the station count. To see a total count of EVSE for all outlets available go to the Alternative Fueling Station Counts by State table. Residential EVSE locations are not included in the Alternative Fueling Station Locator.  ## Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Propane) Stations ### Because many propane stations serve customers other than drivers and fleets NREL collaborated with the industry to effectively represent the differences. Each propane station is designated as a 'primary' or 'secondary' service type. Both types are able to fuel vehicles. However locations with a 'primary' designation offer vehicle services and fuel priced specifically for use in vehicles. The details page for each station lists its service designation.",HTML,,"[alternative-fuels, biodiesel, charging-stations, electric-vehicles, ev, evse, gas-stations, hydrogen, liquefied-petroleum..., lng]",Creative Commons Attribution,,,31,31,,,Alternative Fuels Data Center,2013-11-25T23:59:51.823595,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/alternative-fuels-data-center

574,,City of Chicago,,,This dataset contains the historical estimated congestion for the 29 traffic regions. The Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago’s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O’Hare airport area). There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors including but not limited to frequent intersections traffic signals transit movements availability of alternative routes crashes short length of the segments etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.

The                   statistical entities included are Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs) Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs) tribal designated                   statistical areas (TDSAs) and state designated tribal statistical areas (SDTSAs). Joint use areas are also included in this shapefile refer to areas                   that are administered jointly and/or claimed by two or more American Indian tribes. The Census Bureau designates both legal and statistical joint use                   areas as unique geographic entities for the purpose of presenting statistical data. Note that tribal subdivisions and Alaska Native Regional Corporations                   (ANRCs) are additional types of American Indian/Alaska Native areas stored by the Census Bureau but are displayed in separate shapefiles because of how                   they fall within the Census Bureau's geographic hierarchy. The State of Hawaii's Office of Hawaiian Home Lands provides the legal boundaries for the                   HHLs. The boundaries for ANVSAs OTSAs and TDSAs were delineated for the 2010 Census through the Tribal Statistical Areas Program (TSAP) by participants                   from the federally recognized tribal governments. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) within the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) provides the list                   of federally recognized tribes and only provides legal boundary information when the tribes need supporting records if a boundary is based on treaty or                   another document that is historical or open to legal interpretation or when another tribal state or local government challenges the depiction of a                   reservation or off-reservation trust land.

The MRDS is a large and complex relational database developed over several decades by hundreds of researchers and reporters. While database records describe mineral resources worldwide the compilation of information was intended to cover the United States completely and its coverage of resources in other countries is incomplete. The content of MRDS records was drawn from reports previously published or made available to USGS researchers. Some of those original source materials are no longer available. The information contained in MRDS was intended to reflect the reports used as sources and is current only as of the date of those source reports. Consequently MRDS does not reflect up-to-date changes to the operating status of mines ownership land status production figures and estimates of reserves and resources or the nature size and extent of workings.

NOAA Climate Normals are a large suite of data products that provide users with many tools to understand typical climate conditions for thousands of locations across the United States. As many NWS stations as possible are used including those from the NWS Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) Network as well as some additional stations that have a Weather Bureau Army-Navy (WBAN) station identification number including stations from the Climate Reference Network (CRN).

605,,State of Washington,,,"This dataset is imported from the US Department of Commerce National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and its ""Data Explorer"" site.  The underlying data comes from the US Census   dataset Specifies the month and year of the survey as a string in ""Mon YYYY"" format. The CPS is a monthly survey and NTIA periodically sponsors Supplements to that survey.   variable Contains the standardized name of the variable being measured. NTIA identified the availability of similar data across Supplements and assigned variable names to ease time-series comparisons.   description Provides a concise description of the variable.   universe Specifies the variable representing the universe of persons or households included in the variable's statistics. The specified variable is always included in the file. The only variables lacking universes are isPerson and isHouseholder as they are themselves the broadest universes measured in the CPS.   A large number of Prop PropSE Count and CountSE columns comprise the remainder of the columns. For each demographic being measured (see below) four statistics are produced including the estimated proportion of the group for which the variable is true (Prop) the standard error of that proportion (PropSE) the estimated number of persons or households in that group for which the variable is true (Count) and the standard error of that count (CountSE).    DEMOGRAPHIC CATEGORIES   us The usProp usPropSE usCount and usCountSE columns contain statistics about all persons and households in the universe (which represents the population of the fifty states and the District and Columbia). For example to see how the prevelance of Internet use by Americans has changed over time look at the usProp column for each survey's internetUser variable.   age The age category is divided into five ranges ages 3-14 15-24 25-44 45-64 and 65+. The CPS only includes data on Americans ages 3 and older. Also note that household reference persons must be at least 15 years old so the age314 columns are blank for household-based variables. Those columns are also blank for person-based variables where the universe is ""isAdult"" (or a sub-universe of ""isAdult"") as the CPS defines adults as persons ages 15 or older. Finally note that some variables where children are technically in the univese will show zero values for the age314 columns. This occurs in cases where a variable simply cannot be true of a child (e.g. the workInternetUser variable as the CPS presumes children under 15 are not eligible to work) but the topic of interest is relevant to children (e.g. locations of Internet use).   work Employment status is divided into ""Employed"" ""Unemployed"" and ""NILF"" (Not in the Labor Force). These three categories reflect the official BLS definitions used in official labor force statistics. Note that employment status is only recorded in the CPS for individuals ages 15 and older. As a result children are excluded from the universe when calculating statistics by work status even if they are otherwise considered part of the universe for the variable of interest.   income The income category represents annual family income rather than just an individual person's income. It is divided into five ranges below $25K $25K-49999 $50K-74999 $75K-99999 and $100K or more. Statistics by income group are only available in this file for Supplements beginning in 2010; prior to 2010 family income range is available in public use datasets but is not directly comparable to newer datasets due to the 2010 introduction of the practice of allocating ""don't know"" ""refused"" and other responses that result in missing data. Prior to 2010 family income is unkown for approximately 20 percent of persons while in 2010 the Census Bureau began imputing likely income ranges to replace missing data.   education Educational attainment is divided into ""No Diploma"" ""High School Grad"" ""Some College"" and ""College Grad."" High school graduates are considered to include GED completers and those with some college include community college attendees (and graduates) and those who have attended certain postsecondary vocational or technical schools--in other words it signifies additional education beyond high school but short of attaining a bachelor's degree or equivilent. Note that educational attainment is only recorded in the CPS for individuals ages 15 and older. As a result children are excluded from the universe when calculating statistics by education even if they are otherwise considered part of the universe for the variable of interest.   sex ""Male"" and ""Female"" are the two groups in this category. The CPS does not currently provide response options for intersex individuals.   race This category includes ""White"" ""Black"" ""Hispanic"" ""Asian"" ""Am Indian"" and ""Other"" groups. The CPS asks about Hispanic origin separately from racial identification; as a result all persons identifying as Hispanic are in the Hispanic group regardless of how else they identify. Furthermore all non-Hispanic persons identifying with two or more races are tallied in the ""Other"" group (along with other less-prevelant responses). The Am Indian group includes both American Indians and Alaska Natives.   disability Disability status is divided into ""No"" and ""Yes"" groups indicating whether the person was identified as having a disability. Disabilities screened for in the CPS include hearing impairment vision impairment (not sufficiently correctable by glasses) cognitive difficulties arising from physical mental or emotional conditions serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs difficulty dressing or bathing and difficulties performing errands due to physical mental or emotional conditions. The Census Bureau began collecting data on disability status in June 2008; accordingly this category is unavailable in Supplements prior to that date. Note that disability status is only recorded in the CPS for individuals ages 15 and older.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts however each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. For example Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001 3002 3003.. 3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract. Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3000 people with an optimum size of 1500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant. A BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries but may cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions places urban areas voting districts congressional districts and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas. BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water area no land area and they are generally in territorial seas coastal water and Great Lakes water areas. For Census 2000 rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these offshore water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas.,HTML,,"[boundaries, census, blocks, demographic, population, block group, census tract, tract]",No license information was provided.,,,28,28,,,Tracts 2010 Census,,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/tracts-2010-census

633,,Department of the Treasury,,,These rates are commonly referred to as Constant Maturity Treasury rates or CMTs. Yields are interpolated by the Treasury from the daily yield curve. This curve which relates the yield on a security to its time to maturity is based on the closing market bid yields on actively traded Treasury securities in the over-the-counter market. These market yields are calculated from composites of quotations obtained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The yield values are read from the yield curve at fixed maturities currently 1 3 and 6 months and 1 2 3 5 7 10 20 and 30 years. This method provides a yield for a 10 year maturity for example even if no outstanding security has exactly 10 years remaining to maturity.,HTML,,"[daily-yield-curve, interest, interest-rates, rates, real-yield-curve, statistics, yield, yield-curve]",Creative Commons CCZero,,,27,27,,,Interest Rate Statistics - Daily Treasury Yield Curve Rates,2018-02-26,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/interest-rate-statistics-daily-treasury-yield-curve-rates

635,,Department of the Interior,,,Bee conservation broadly speaking has four main objectives  1) to conserve the individual species of native bees 2) to conserve the ecological services (pollination of native plants) provided by native bees 3) to  bring more native bee species into  agricultural service and  4) to maintain the health and viability of honey bees for agricultural purposes. Three of these objectives relate directly to native habitats and in order to  begin to address  them it is necessary to identify which bee species are present within a particular geography and to gain a basic understanding of the span of their ecological tolerances and  abundance. Native habitats and communities offer the best starting point  for this effort because  they are reservoirs of biodiversity compared to disturbed areas urban parks habitat reconstructions etc.  The project summarized in these following pages initiated in 2012 and enabled by staff and volunteers and the US Fish and Wildlife Service is a first step towards identifying and documenting the bee species present  on selected refuges in the Midwest and  also provides limited data on their ecological amplitude and  abundance.        Collecting effort  in 2013 varied from refuge to refuge as did the number of sampling sites and the intent or design of the survey at each refuge. Some refuges were interested in comparing remnants to reconstructions others compared different native habitat types others were simply interested in an overall survey of the refuge. The value of the data to each refuge is largely proportional to the effort expended but even limited collecting effort provided some valuable data.,DOCX,,"[floodplain, general-biology-com..., general-biology-com..., general-biology-spe..., general-biology-spe..., grasslands, inventory, native-bees, refuges]",No license information was provided.

The SST analysis has a spatial grid resolution of 0.25 (1/4) degree and temporal resolution of 1 day. The product uses Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data from the Pathfinder AVHRR SST dataset when available for September 1981 through December 2005 and the operational Navy AVHRR Multi-Channel SST data for 2006 to the present day. Pathfinder AVHRR SST was chosen because of good agreement with the in situ observation data. The product also uses sea ice datasets in situ data from ships and buoys and includes a large-scale adjustment of satellite biases with respect to the in situ data. In areas where sea ice is present SST is estimated from sea ice concentration datasets from NASA GSFC before 2005 and then from NOAA NCEP from 2005 onwards. Preliminary products are produced daily in near real-time (1-day latency) and may be updated in the first few days if critical input data become available after the initial production time.

Data are as of June 30. Users can access these data by(1) single institution (2) institutions within a geographic area or (3) aggregated within a geographic area. SOD features include custom market share reports and downloads.Linkhttp//www2.fdic.gov/sod/Scope of the SurveysTo provide a means for measuring deposits in local banking markets the surveys obtain deposit figures for each banking office of branch banking systems and for each insured U.S. branch of a foreign bank. Deposit figures for unit banks (which do not have branch offices) were obtained from the June Reports of Condition. Deposit Reporting - Institutions should report their deposits in a manner consistent with their existing internal record-keeping practices however other methods that logically reflect the deposit gathering activity of the bank's branches may be used. It is recognized that certain classes of deposits and deposits of certain types of customers may be assigned to a single office. Please refer to the reporting instructions for more information (see above). Arrangement of Published DataBecause these publications are used as a source of market share information for individual banking markets the figures for each geographical area only include deposits of offices located within that area. Several institutions have designated home offices that do not accept deposits; these have been included in the survey to provide a more complete listing of all offices. Additional points that should be noted1. With the exception noted above 'banking office' is defined to include all offices and facilities that actually hold deposits and does not include loan production offices computer centers and other nondeposit installations such as automated teller machines (ATMs). 2. Institutions are allowed to combine deposit data from two or more offices within the same county for the following office typesdrive-in offices seasonal branches and military facilities. Where centralized bookkeeping or other conditions make it impossible to report exact figures estimates are required. 3. International Banking Facility (IBF) deposits are considered deposits in foreign offices and are not included in the Summary of Deposits Survey. 4. Offices and deposits are reported by the institution that owned the office as of the close of business on June 30. 5. The term 'offices' includes both main offices and branches. An institution with four branches operates a total of five offices. 6. All reports submitted to the FDIC and the OTS have been validated and corrected to the extent possible. There may be rounding differences or minor reporting errors reflected in the tables. 7.

680,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce",,,"Tsunami is a Japanese word meaning harbor wave. It is a water wave or a series of waves generated by an impulsive vertical displacement of the surface of the ocean or other body of water. This slide set depicts advancing waves harbor damage and structural damage from seven tsunami events which have occurred since 1946 in the Pacific region. The set includes before-and-after views of Scotch Cap Lighthouse (the Aleutian Islands).Tsunami is a Japanese word meaning ""harbor wave."" It is a water wave or a series of waves generated by an impulsive vertical displacement of the surface of the ocean or other body of water. Tsunamis are commonly called seismic sea waves or incorrectly tidal waves. The term ""tidal wave"" is frequently used in the older literature and in popular accounts but is now considered incorrect. Tides are produced by the rotational attraction of the sun and moon and occur predictably with twelve hour periods. The effects of a tsunami may be increased or decreased depending on the level of the tide but otherwise the two phenomena are independent.Major tsunamis occur in the Pacific Ocean region only about once per decade. These major events such as that in Prince William Sound Alaska in March 1964 and the tsunami generated off the coast of Chile in 1960 have been devastating over large distances. Tsunamis have been responsible for thousands of fatalities especially in Japan and Indonesia.Most tsunamis are caused by a rapid vertical movement along a break in Earth's crust (i.e. their origin is tectonic). A tsunami is generated when a large mass of earth on the bottom of the ocean drops or rises thereby displacing the column of water directly above it. This type of displacement commonly occurs in large subduction zones where the collision of two tectonic plates causes the oceanic plate to dip beneath the continental plate to form deep ocean trenches. Shallow tsunamigenic earthquakes occur offshore in these trenches. Subduction occurs along most of the island arcs and coastal areas of the Pacific except for the west coast of the United States and Canada. Such trench areas off continental coasts and island arcs are generating areas for major tsunamis affecting the entire Pacific Basin.Volcanic eruptions have also generated significant tsunamis resulting in death tolls as high as 30000 people from a single event as in the Krakatoa eruption of 1883. Tsunamis effectively transmit energy to areas outside the reach of the volcanic eruption itself. The most efficient methods of tsunami generation by volcanoes include disruption of a body of water by the collapse of all or part of the volcanic edifice subsidence an explosion a landslide a glowing avalanche and an earthquake accompanying or preceding the eruption. Roughly one-half of all volcanic tsunamis are generated at calderas or at cones within calderas. Submarine eruptions may also cause minor tsunamis.The largest tsunamis are caused by meteorite impact in ocean basins. While there have been none recorded in historical times tsunamis from the Chixulub Yucatan crater (66 million years b.p.) were up to 5 km high. Tsunami deposits have been found in west Texas nearly 1000 kilometers inland. Modelling shows that a moderate size meteor impact in the Atlantic Ocean would have devastating results along the entire Atlantic seaboard of the United States. Such impacts are expected on an average of once in about 15000 years.Subaerial and submarine landslides into bays or lakes have generated locally destructive tsunamis. Other possible but less efficient methods of tsunami generation also exist. More than one mechanism commonly is involved in the generation of a tsunami including vertical movement of the crust by a seismic impulse (an earthquake) or a submarine landslide.Tsunamis have been reported since ancient times. They have been documented extensively especially in Japan and the Mediterranean areas. One of the first recorded tsunamis may have occurred off the coast of Syria in 2000 B.C. Since 1900 (the beginning of instrumentally-located earthquakes) most tsunamis have been generated off the coast of Japan Peru and Chile. The only regions that have generated remote-source tsunamis affecting the entire Pacific Basin are the Kamchatka Peninsula the Aleutian Islands the Gulf of Alaska and the coast of South America. Hawaii because of its location in the center of the Pacific Basin has experienced tsunamis generated in all parts of the Pacific.The Atlantic Ocean has less tsunamis than the Pacific. Most tsunamis in the Atlantic Ocean are generated by great earthquakes west of Portugal. These can be destructive on both sides of the Atlantic. In the Atlantic Ocean there are no subduction zones at the edges of plate boundaries to spawn tsunamis except small subduction zones under the Caribbean and Scotia arcs. The Caribbean and Mediterranean Seas both have histories of locally destructive tsunamis. In the Indian Ocean the Indo-Australian plate is being subducted beneath the Eurasian plate at its east margin. Most tsunamis generated in this area are propagated toward the southwest shores of Java and Sumatra rather than into the Indian Ocean. However only a few tsunamis have been recorded as originating in the Indian Ocean.Our knowledge of tsunamis is incomplete. The generation phenomenon has not been observed nor measured directly. Large tsunami events are somewhat rare and therefore difficult to capture on high quality slides or videos. However photographs can contribute significantly to our understanding of tsunamis by recording permanently the heights and the damaging effects of the waves of past tsunami events.",HTML,,"[coastal erosion, ocean waves, global, soils, doc/noaa/nesdis/ncei, infoterra, disasters, earth science, wave erosion, coastal processes, landslides, icsu-wds, catastrophic phenomena, erosion, national centers fo..., nesdis, noaa, u.s. department of ..., lithosphere, oceans, water erosion, coastal ecosystems, tsunamis, terrestrial ecosystems, seismic sea waves, doc/noaa/nesdis/ngdc, tsunami, seismic activity, marine environments, international counc..., national geophysica..., nesdis, noaa, u.s. department of ...]",U.S. Government Work,,,25,25,,,Tsunamis - General,,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/tsunamis-general

687,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce",,,"Declining health of coral reef ecosystems led scientists to search for factors that support reef resilience the ability of reefs to resist and recover from environmental disturbance. Scientists recently identified 11 measurable factors that affect the resilience of coral reefs (McClanahan et al. 2012). Reef resilience factors include characteristics of the coral assemblage populations of fish that live on the reef land use practices and water temperature variability. These factors were used by NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) Coral Reef Ecosystem Program (CREP) to conduct a quantitative assessment of the resilience potential of reefs across the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI).   Locations of Rapid Ecological Assessment (REA) surveys conducted by NOAA Coral Reef Ecosystem Program (CREP) from 2010 to 2013 were used to designate study units called ""georegions"". Watersheds upstream of georegions were then grouped to delineate the area that could affect adjacent reefs through pollution runoff and sedimentation. REA surveys provided data to evaluate biological/ecological resilience factors and external data sources were used to inform physical and environmental factors not directly measured by CREP. Five of the resilience factors can be directly influenced by local management. Data for each factor was compiled normalized and averaged to produce a composite resilience score for each georegion.  In all twenty-nine study areas were analyzed across the MHI.

688,,Department of Agriculture,,,The Dietary Supplement Ingredient Database (DSID) is a collaborative venture with the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements the US Department of Agriculture and other federal agencies to provide analytically-derived estimates of ingredients in dietary supplements. Release 2 of the DSID reports national estimates for vitamins and minerals in adult and children's multivitamins (MVMs) ( http//dsid.usda.nih.gov).  For the DSID studies representative supplement products are identified sampled and analyzed by experienced laboratories. In order to obtain accurate results a quality assurance and quality control plan are established for each study with standard reference materials in-house control materials and product duplicate results assessed before product data are accepted as final.  Laboratory data are then statistically evaluated by ingredient and weighted by market share information if available. For the MVM studies released in DSID-2 data are reported by ingredient across a range of labeled levels.  Results are predicted by regression and estimate mean percent differences from label and standard errors at these labeled levels. These data can be used by researchers to more accurately quantify nutrient intake from dietary supplements.,XLSX,,"[dietary-supplement, multivitamin, nutrient-compositio..., nutrition, vitamin]",Creative Commons Attribution,,,25,25,,,Dietary Supplement Ingredient Database,2014-12-23,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/dietary-supplement-ingredient-database

Joint use areas are also included in this shapefile refer to areas that are administered jointly and/or claimed by two or more American Indian tribes. The Census Bureau designates both legal and statistical joint use areas as unique geographic entities for the purpose of presenting statistical data. Note that tribal subdivisions and Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs) are additional types of American Indian/Alaska Native areas stored by the Census Bureau but are displayed in separate shapefiles because of how they fall within the Census Bureau's geographic hierarchy.

These boundary files are specifically designed for small-scale thematic mapping. When possible generalization is performed with the intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year. Geographic areas may not align with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available as nation-based files while others are available only as state-based files.  ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are approximate area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas that the Census Bureau creates to present statistical data for each decennial census. The Census Bureau delineates ZCTA boundaries for the United States Puerto Rico American Samoa Guam the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands once each decade following the decennial census. Data users should not use ZCTAs to identify the official USPS ZIP Code for mail delivery. The USPS makes periodic changes to ZIP Codes to support more efficient mail delivery.  The Census Bureau uses tabulation blocks as the basis for defining each ZCTA. Tabulation blocks are assigned to a ZCTA based on the most frequently occurring ZIP Code for the addresses contained within that block. The most frequently occurring ZIP Code also becomes the five-digit numeric code of the ZCTA. These codes may contain leading zeros.  Blocks that do not contain addresses but are surrounded by a single ZCTA (enclaves) are assigned to the surrounding ZCTA. Because the Census Bureau only uses the most frequently occurring ZIP Code to assign blocks a ZCTA may not exist for every USPS ZIP Code. Some ZIP Codes may not have a matching ZCTA because too few addresses were associated with the specific ZIP Code or the ZIP Code was not the most frequently occurring ZIP Code within any of the blocks where it exists.

The surveys are designed to provide quarterly as well as annual estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs alcohol and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime annual and past-month usage for the following drug classes marijuana cocaine (and crack) hallucinogens heroin inhalants alcohol tobacco and nonmedical use of prescription drugs including pain relievers tranquilizers stimulants and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts health care access and coverage illegal activities and arrest record problems resulting from the use of drugs and needle-sharing. Certain questions are asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17.

It relates to the geocode in the DOR's Orion database (Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal data - CAMA). Most of the ancillary attribute information is held in this database. Information such as owner name legal description and appraised value as well as structural and agricultural data are available within CAMA. SQL Server Express 2000 R2 database files of individual county CAMA data are available for download at the project website listed above. In addition a SQL Server Express database of selected attributes is available for the entire state. Parcel data is built upon the USDI Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) Geographic Coordinate Database (GCDB). The GCDB is a complex measurement management system that uses a least squares adjustment of existing survey data to come up with a digital representation of the Public Land Survey System (PLSS). For more information on GCDB you should proceed to the Montana/North Dakota BLM website at http//www.blm.gov/mt/st/en/res/public_room/cadastral_survey/gcdb.html.

These products are available on CD-ROM and the Internet. The goal of the project is to assess the undiscovered technically recoverable oil and gas resources of the world. Two previously published digital geologic data sets (U.S. and Caribbean) were clipped to the map extent while the dataset for Mexico was digitized for this project. Original attributes for all data layers were maintained and in some cases graphically merged with common symbology for presentation purposes. The world has been divided into geologic provinces that are used for allocation and prioritization of oil and gas assessments. For the World Energy Project a subset of those provinces is shown on this map. Each province has a set of geologic characteristics that distinguish it from surrounding provinces. These characteristics may include dominant lithologies the age of the strata and/or structural type.

ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are approximate area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas that the Census Bureau creates to present statistical data for each decennial census. The Census Bureau delineates ZCTA boundaries for the United States Puerto Rico American Samoa Guam the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands once each decade following the decennial census. Data users should not use ZCTAs to identify the official USPS ZIP Code for mail delivery. The USPS makes periodic changes to ZIP Codes to support more efficient mail delivery.  The Census Bureau uses tabulation blocks as the basis for defining each ZCTA. Tabulation blocks are assigned to a ZCTA based on the most frequently occurring ZIP Code for the addresses contained within that block. The most frequently occurring ZIP Code also becomes the five-digit numeric code of the ZCTA. These codes may contain leading zeros.  Blocks that do not contain addresses but are surrounded by a single ZCTA (enclaves) are assigned to the surrounding ZCTA. Because the Census Bureau only uses the most frequently occurring ZIP Code to assign blocks a ZCTA may not exist for every USPS ZIP Code. Some ZIP Codes may not have a matching ZCTA because too few addresses were associated with the specific ZIP Code or the ZIP Code was not the most frequently occurring ZIP Code within any of the blocks where it exists.

This dataset includes 2013 2014 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5) health outcomes (13) and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Division of Population Health Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2013 2014) Census Bureau 2010 census population data and American Community Survey (ACS) 2009-2013 2010-2014 estimates. More information about the methodology can be found at www.cdc.gov/500cities.

859,,Department of State,,,The Office of the Geographer’s Global Large Scale International Boundary Detailed Polygons file combines two datasets the Office of the Geographer’s Large Scale International Boundary Lines and NGA shoreline data.  The LSIB is believed to be the most accurate worldwide (non- W. Europe) international boundary vector line file available. The lines reflect U.S. government (USG) policy and thus not necessarily de facto control. The 1250000 scale World Vector Shoreline (WVS) coastline data was used in places and is generally shifted by several hundred meters to over a km. There are no restrictions on use of this public domain data.  The Tesla Government PiX team performed topology checks and other GIS processing while merging data sets created more accurate island shoreline in numerous cases and worked closely with the US Dept. of State Office of the Geographer on quality control checks.  Methodology    Tesla Government’s Protected Internet Exchange (PiX) GIS team converted the LSIB linework and the  island data provided by the State Department to polygons.  The LSIB Admin 0 world polygons (Admin 0 polygons) were created by conflating the following datasets Eurasia_Oceania_LSIB7a_gen_polygons Africa_Americas_LSIB7a_gen_polygons Africa_Americas_LSIB7a Eurasia_LSIB7a additional updates from LSIB8 WVS shoreline data and other shoreline data from United States Government (USG) sources.    The two simplified polygon shapefiles were merged dissolved and converted to lines to create a single global coastline dataset.  The two detailed line shapefiles (Eurasia_LSIB7a and Africa_Americas_LSIB7a) were merged with each other and the coastlines to create an international boundary shapefile with coastlines.  The dataset was reviewed for the following topological errors must not self overlap must not overlap and must not have dangles.  Once all topological errors were fixed the lines were converted to polygons.  Attribution was assigned by exploding the simplified polygons into multipart features converting to centroids and spatially joining with the newly created dataset.  The polygons were then dissolved by country name.    Another round of QC was performed on the dataset through the data reviewer tool to ensure that the conversion worked correctly.  Additional errors identified during this process consisted of islands shifted from their true locations and not representing their true shape; these were adjusted using high resolution imagery whereupon a second round of QC was applied with SRTM digital elevation model data downloaded from USGS.  The same procedure was performed for every individual island contained in the islands from other USG sources. After the island dataset went through another round of QC it was then merged with the Admin 0 polygon shapefile to form a comprehensive world dataset.

The stratification produced 3923 terrestrial ecological land units (ELUs) at a base resolution of 250 meters. The ELUs were derived from data on land surface features in a three step approach. The first step involved acquiring or developing four global raster datalayers representing the primary components of ecosystem structure bioclimate landform lithology and land cover. These datasets generally represent the most accurate current globally comprehensive and finest spatial and thematic resolution data available for each of the four inputs. The second step involved a spatial combination of the four inputs into a single new integrated raster dataset where every cell represents a combination of values from the bioclimate landforms lithology and land cover datalayers.

Working with these state offices the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) established the NDI as a resource to aid epidemiologists and other health and medical investigators with their mortality ascertainment activities.    Assists investigators in determining whether persons in their studies have died and if so provide the names of the states in which those deaths occurred the dates of death and the corresponding death certificate numbers. Investigators can then make arrangements with the appropriate state offices to obtain copies of death certificates or specific statistical information such as manner of death or educational level. Cause of death codes may also be obtained using the NDI Plus service.    Records from 1979 through 2011 are currently available and contain a standard set of identifying information on each death. Death records are added to the NDI file annually approximately 12 months after the end of a particular calendar year. 2012 should be available summer 2014.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts however each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.  ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are approximate area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas that the Census Bureau creates to present statistical data for each decennial census. The Census Bureau delineates ZCTA boundaries for the United States Puerto Rico American Samoa Guam the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands once each decade following the decennial census. Data users should not use ZCTAs to identify the official USPS ZIP Code for mail delivery. The USPS makes periodic changes to ZIP Codes to support more efficient mail delivery.  The Census Bureau uses tabulation blocks as the basis for defining each ZCTA. Tabulation blocks are assigned to a ZCTA based on the most frequently occurring ZIP Code for the addresses contained within that block. The most frequently occurring ZIP Code also becomes the five-digit numeric code of the ZCTA. These codes may contain leading zeros.  Blocks that do not contain addresses but are surrounded by a single ZCTA (enclaves) are assigned to the surrounding ZCTA. Because the Census Bureau only uses the most frequently occurring ZIP Code to assign blocks a ZCTA may not exist for every USPS ZIP Code. Some ZIP Codes may not have a matching ZCTA because too few addresses were associated with the specific ZIP Code or the ZIP Code was not the most frequently occurring ZIP Code within any of the blocks where it exists.

This official U.S. time is the NIST estimate of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and called UTC(NIST). The accuracy of UTC(NIST) as distributed through the Internet Time Service (ITS) is on the order of 0.001 seconds (one millisecond) although accuracy can vary depending on network conditions and other parameters.    Note that unlike most traditional datasets time is intrinsically a transient ever-changing quantity. As soon as UTC(NIST) is transmitted to a client that particular value of UTC(NIST) no longer reflects the current time which is constantly changing. There is thus no static storage of any time data apart from internal diagnostic information not released to the public which ensures that UTC(NIST) as disseminated through the Internet Time Service (ITS) is commensurate with the official UTC(NIST) realization within the uncertainties of the system.     The vast majority of UTC(NIST) information distributed through ITS is provided freely anonymously and automatically to the public. Any IP address can request UTC(NIST) through the ITS and the information is automatically and anonymously provided at no cost to the user. Full documentation of the ITS including all the source code is available to the public through the web site http//www.nist.gov/pml/div688/.    NIST provides an authenticated version of ITS to a limited number of users (approximately 500 users near the end of calendar year 2015) who for various reasons want to ensure they are receiving UTC(NIST) without spoofing or interference with the information.

921,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce",,,"A solar flare is a short-lived sudden increase in the intensity of radiation emitted in the neighborhood of sunspots. For many years it was best monitored in the H-alpha wavelength and occurs in the chromosphere though occasionally white light flares are seen in the photosphere. In modern times the solar X-ray wavelengths are monitored via satellite for solar flares. Flares are characterized by a rise time of the order of minutes and a decay time of the order of tens of minutes. The total energy expended in a typical flare is about 1030 ergs; the magnetic field is extraordinarily high reaching values of 100 to 10000 gauss. Optical flares in H-alpha are usually accompanied by radio and X-ray bursts and occasionally by high-energy particle emissions.              The optical brightness and size of the flare are indicated by a two-character code called ""importance."" The first character a number from 1 to 4 indicates the apparent area. For areas of less than 1 an ""S"" is used to designate a subflare. The second character indicates relative brilliance B for bright N for normal and F for faint. A general discussion of solar flares is found in Svestka [1976]. The NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (formerly NGDC) holds archives for about 80 stations covering the period 1938 to the present. Currently 5 stations send their data to NGDC Boulder on a routine monthly basis -- the current main observing emphasis for Space Weather has transitioned to Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) which directly impact the Earth's geomagnetic field.

930,,Department of Agriculture,,,The rural-urban commuting area codes (RUCA) classify U.S. census tracts using measures of urbanization population density and daily commuting from the decennial census.  The most recent RUCA codes are based on data from the 2000 decennial census. The classification contains two levels. Whole numbers (1-10) delineate metropolitan micropolitan small town and rural commuting areas based on the size and direction of the primary (largest) commuting flows. These 10 codes are further subdivided to permit stricter or looser delimitation of commuting areas based on secondary (second largest) commuting flows. The approach errs in the direction of more codes providing flexibility in combining levels to meet varying definitional needs and preferences.  The 1990 codes are similarly defined. However the Census Bureau's methods of defining urban cores and clusters changed between the two censuses. And census tracts changed in number and shapes. The 2000 rural-urban commuting codes are not directly comparable with the 1990 codes because of these differences.

Derived from the NED using a hill shade technique this base map represents a continental view showing shaded relief from USGS NED layers at resolutions of 1/3- 1- and 2-arc-second (in Alaska only). This hillshade is actually five separate shaded relief datasets created from the original terrain data. Each shaded relief has different azimuths and altitude values as follows 0 45 135 60 270 45 315 45 45 45. These five datasets are then combined into one feature class using map algebra to compute the raster layers using the following equation (shadedrelief1 + shadedrelief2 + shadedrelief3 + (shadedrelief4 x 2) + shaded relief5 / 6). This equation gives double importance to the 315 degrees azimuth and 45 degrees altitude. Color characteristics are the result of applying a color ramp in which RGB values range from near-white (RGB 255 255 252) to brown (RGB 156 142 107). The color ramp was applied with a stretch type of 4.3 standard deviations since the scale of brightness values range from 130 to 1240. Contrast (24 percent) and brightness (3 percent) enhancements were applied for cartographic purposes.

963,,"U.S. Geological Survey, Department of the Interior",,,This data set collection contains imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP). The NAIP program is administered by USDA FSA and has been established to support two main FSA strategic goals centered on agricultural production. These are increase stewardship of America's natural resources while enhancing the environment and to ensure commodities are procured and distributed effectively and efficiently to increase food security. The NAIP program supports these goals by acquiring and providing ortho imagery that has been collected during the agricultural growing season in the U.S. The NAIP ortho imagery is tailored to meet FSA requirements and is a fundamental tool used to support FSA farm and conservation programs. Ortho imagery provides an effective intuitive means of communication about farm program administration between FSA and stakeholders. New technology and innovation is identified by fostering and maintaining a relationship with vendors and government partners and by keeping pace with the broader geospatial community. As a result of these efforts the NAIP program provides three main products DOQQ tiles Compressed County Mosaics (CCM) and Seamline shape files. The Contract specifications for NAIP imagery have changed over time reflecting agency requirements and improving technologies. These changes include image resolution horizontal accuracy coverage area and number of bands. In general flying seasons are established by FSA and are targeted for peak crop growing conditions. The NAIP acquisition cycle is based on a minimum 3 year update of base ortho imagery. The tiling format of the NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 pixel buffer on all four sides. NAIP quarter quads are formatted to the UTM coordinate system using the North American Datum of 1983.

970,,Department of Housing and Urban Development,,,The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Developments (HUD) Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCVP) is the federal government's major program for assisting very low-income families the elderly and the disabled with decent safe sanitary and affordable housing in the private market. Since housing assistance is provided on behalf of the family or individual participants are able to find their own housing including single-family homes townhouses and apartments. The participant is free to choose any housing that meets the requirements of the program and is not limited to units located in subsidized housing projects. Housing choice vouchers (HCV) are administered locally by public housing agencies (PHAs). The PHAs receive federal funds from HUD to administer the voucher program. A family that is issued a housing voucher is responsible for finding a suitable housing unit where the owner agrees to rent under the program. This unit may include the family's present residence. Rental units must meet minimum standards of health and safety as determined by the PHA. A housing subsidy is paid to the landlord directly by the PHA on behalf of the participating family. The family then pays the difference between the actual rent charged by the landlord and the amount subsidized by the program. Under certain circumstances if authorized by the PHA a family may use its voucher to purchase a modest home.HCV locations are identified in public records by the owner and not the tenant so access to this information is restricted to help safeguard the location of HCV units. Due to the sensitive nature of the HCV locations these are aggregated to the U.S. Census Bureaus census tract geography.,BIN,,"[2010-census-tracts, 2012, assisted-housing, boundaries, census, hcv, housing, housing-choice-vouc..., national-geospatial..., ndga, ngda-portfolio-themes, polygon, puerto-rico, real-property-theme, section-8, society, united-states]",No license information was provided.

The strength of the survey is that it allows data users to relate the expenditures and income of consumers to the characteristics of those consumers. The survey consists of two components a quarterly Interview Survey and a weekly Diary Survey each with its own questionnaire and sample. For the     Diary survey respondents complete a diary of expenses for two consecutive 1-week periods. The Diary survey is designed to obtain data on frequently purchased items such as food or housekeeping supplies that respondents are less likely to recall over time. For the Interview survey respondents report data to an interviewer. Each sample household is interviewed once per quarter for five consectutive quarters.

1008,,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,,,This data set has been collected from a custom built battery prognostics testbed at the NASA Ames Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE). Li-ion batteries were run through 3 different operational profiles (charge discharge and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy) at different temperatures. Discharges were carried out at different current load levels until the battery voltage fell to preset voltage thresholds. Some of these thresholds were lower than that recommended by the OEM (2.7 V) in order to induce deep discharge aging effects. Repeated charge and discharge cycles result in accelerated aging of the batteries. The experiments were stopped when the batteries reached the end-of-life (EOL) criteria of 30% fade in rated capacity (from 2 Ah to 1.4 Ah).  Data Acquisition   The testbed comprises  * Commercially available Li-ion 18650 sized rechargeable batteries * Programmable 4-channel DC electronic load * Programmable 4-channel DC power supply * Voltmeter ammeter and thermocouple sensor suite * Custom EIS equipment * Environmental chamber to impose various operational conditions * PXI chassis based DAQ and experiment control and MATLAB based experiment control data acquisition and prognostics algorithm evaluation setup (appx. data acquisition rate is 10Hz).

We conducted replicated 10-min surveys at 111 points located along 9 transects occurring over gradients of physical and biotic habitat conditions and recorded observations of individual birds identified to species. Survey points or sites were located approximately 500 m apart and observations of birds were limited to a maximum distance of 250 m to prevent double counting. We visited each survey site 2[HTML_REMOVED]3 times and assumed community closure within the survey period. Mean interval ([HTML_REMOVED][HTML_REMOVED]SD) between site-specific surveys was 5.8 [HTML_REMOVED][HTML_REMOVED] 2.4 days. We measured 13 vegetative characteristics at 10 subsampling points associated with each bird survey location during 26 June [HTML_REMOVED] 11 July 2012. Five subsampling plots were located along each of two 20-m transects with random orientation (0[HTML_REMOVED]359 degrees). One transect originated at the bird survey point and the other at a point selected randomly within 250 m of the bird survey point. At each subsampling point we estimated overlapping coverages within six vegetation classes including alder (Alnus spp.) dwarf birch (Betula spp.) ericaceous shrubs (e.g. Empetrum Vaccinium spp.) herbaceous lichen (e.g. Cladonia spp.) and willow (Salix spp.) using a 0.5-m2 quadrat frame and recorded the height of the tallest plant of each type within the sampling frame.

1037,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce",,,"NOAA's National Climatic Data Center is now producing the Regional Snowfall Index (RSI) for significant snowstorms that impact the eastern two thirds of the U.S. The RSI ranks snowstorm impacts on a scale from 1 to 5 similar to the Fujita scale for tornadoes or the Saffir-Simpson scale for hurricanes. NCDC has analyzed and assigned RSI values to over 500 storms going as far back as 1900. New storms are added operationally. As such RSI puts the regional impacts of snowstorms into a century-scale historical perspective. The RSI differs from other indices because it includes population. RSI is based on the spatial extent of the storm the amount of snowfall and the juxtaposition of these elements with population. The area and population are cumulative values above regional specific thresholds. For example the thresholds for the Southeast are 2"" 5"" 10"" and 15"" of snowfall while the thresholds for the Northeast are 4"" 10"" 20"" and 30"" of snowfall. Population information ties the index to societal impacts. Currently the index uses population based on the 2000 Census. The RSI is an evolution of the Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale (NESIS) which NCDC began producing operationally in 2005. While NESIS was developed for storms that had a major impact in the Northeast it includes the impact of snow on other regions as well. It can be thought of as a quasi-national index that is calibrated to Northeast snowstorms. By contrast the RSI is a regional index; a separate index is produced for each of the six NCDC climate regions in the eastern two-thirds of the nation. The indices are calculated in a similar fashion to NESIS but our experience has led us to propose a change in the methodology. The new indices require region-specific parameters and thresholds for the calculations.

1055,,Department of the Interior,,,In 2010-2013 Utah State University partnered with the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to conduct invasive plant prioritization workshops and inventories on selected National Wildlife Refuges across the United States.  The purpose of these workshops and subsequent inventories was to inform and improve the process of planning and implementing invasive plant inventories or early detection.  These workshops highlighted the need for an objective transparent and documented process for deciding which invasive plant species should be a focus of inventory or early detection (and ultimately management) and where. A result of this partnership is the Invasive Plant Inventory and Early Detection Prioritization Tool (IPIEDT) and associated user's guide.  The tool is a Microsoft Access database (2010 or later) that utilizes site-specific knowledge and harnesses existing species information (e.g. California Invasive Plant Council invasive species rankings) to identify priority species and areas for inventory or early detection. The user's guide describes how to use the IPIEDT.  Although the IPIEDT was developed for the National Wildlife Refuge System it can be applied wherever invasive plants pose a threat to natural resources. The tool produces a ranked list of areas and invasive plant species to consider for inventory or early detection. Users can also create area-specific ranked species lists or lists that distinguish species occurring within or outside (early detection) the spatial scope of the project. The user's guide 1) describes the design of the invasive plant inventory and early detection prioritization tool (IPIEDT) 2) describes and provide the rationale of criteria used to rank species and areas and 3) provides step-by-step instructions on how to use the tool.  Appendix A of the guide describes ranking criteria and corresponding scales of the IPIEDT.  Appendix B of the guide provides a step-by-step guide to the prioritization process and use of the IPIEDT.

This dataset was comprised of data from this legacy system.  Our new system went online on 10/2/2017.  We are working towards providing the purchase orders from the new system and hope to have it available by the end of October.  Listing of all purchase orders issued to procure goods and/or services within City-Parish.  In the City-Parish Purchasing system a purchase order (PO) is made up of two components a header and one or many detail items that comprise the overarching PO. The header contains information that pertains to the entire PO. This includes but is not limited to  the total amount of the PO the department requesting the purchase and the vendor providing the goods or services. The detail item(s) contain information that is specific to the individual item ordered or service procured through the Purchase Order. The item/service description item/service quantity and the cost of the item is located within the Purchase Order details. There may be one or many detail items on an individual Purchase Order. For example a Purchase Order for a computer equipment may include three items the computer the monitor and the base software package.  Both header information and detail item information are included in this dataset in order to provide a comprehensive view of the purchase order data. The Record Type field indicates whether the record is a header record (H) or detail item record (D). In the computer purchase example from above the system would display 4 records – one header record and 3 detail item records.  It should be noted header information will be duplicated on all detail items.

1080,,Department of Energy,,,"Field Samples are physical media collected during the response which are subsequently analyzed either in a laboratory or in the field using InSitu equipment. Common field samples include air filters and soil samples. Radiochemistry analysis typically reports the presence of specific radionuclides measured as total activity or as either activity/unit of mass or activity/unit of volume depending upon the sample media. In addition total beta and total alpha activity may be reported. Currently air filter and soil sample analysis results may be downloaded through the data repository. Both data sets are similar; they contain a number of columns describing the collected sample as well as the results of radiochemical analysis. In addition there are a number of special fields that are specific to a given sample type; e.g. Air Filters specify the filter type and total volume while soil samples specify the sample weight. For convenience the sample information and subsequent analysis has been ""flattened"" into a simple tabular format. Consequently if a sample has multiple analysis results the ""sample collection"" values will be repeated through the set; e.g. sample ID# barcode latitude/longitude collection date etc. To be included in the data repository a given sample must meet the following criteria has a valid latitude longitude and collection date; has been sent to a laboratory for analysis or had analysis performed in the field; has at least one valid analysis result with a reportable unit nuclide and activity which has been validated by an authorized laboratory staff member.

1097,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce",,,U.S. Enhanced Hourly Wind Station Data is digital data set DSI-6421 archived at the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI; formerly National Climatic Data Center NCDC). During earlier work at NCDC it was noted that anemometer elevations at U.S. weather stations (for which metadata related to anemometer height was available) varied widely with time. Between 1931 and 2000 there were up to 12 significant anemometer height changes at some of these stations and on average there was one change per decade at any station with more than 10 years of record. For example at Los Angeles International Airport the anemometer height changed 4 times during the 60 years varying from 59 ft to 20 ft while at Edwards Air Force Base the anemometer height was changed 10 times and varied from 13 ft to 75 ft. Therefore the elevation homogenization of the near-surface wind time series is a necessary pre-requisite for any climatological assessments. This was done at NCDC creating the DSI-6421 data set. Stations were included in DSI-6421 on a year-by-year basis depending upon the availability of anemometer metadata and the number of observations made during a year. The earliest data was from 1931 with very few stations. The number of stations increased during World War II to about 200 decreased briefly after the war and increased to about 350 during the period 1948-1972 because most first-order (primary) stations qualified for inclusion. After 1972 as the importance of metadata was more widely recognized the number of qualified stations rose to near 1000 by 1985 and continued at about that number through year 2000. The formulae used were U10g = Ua log[(10-Hsnod)/z0]/log[(Ha - Hsnod)/z0] and U10s = Ua log[10/z0]/log[(Ha - Hsnod)/z0] where z0 is the surface roughness (a function of the presence of snow cover at the site); Hsnod is the snow depth; Ha is the anemometer height above the ground; Ua is the wind speed at the anemometer height; U10g is the speed at 10 m above the ground; and U10s is the speed at 10 m above the surface.,XML,,"[atmosphere, united states of am..., north america, anemometer height a..., doc/noaa/nesdis/ncei, continent, earth science, anemometers, vertical location, altitude, wind speed/wind dir..., automated surface o..., land surface, automated weather s..., national centers fo..., nesdis, noaa, u.s. department of ..., national climatic d..., nesdis, noaa, u.s. department of ..., ground stations, aws, awos, station height, surface winds, doc/noaa/nesdis/ncdc, atmospheric winds, automated weather o..., asos]",U.S. Government Work,,,16,16,,,Enhanced Hourly Wind Station Data for the Contiguous United States,,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/enhanced-hourly-wind-station-data-for-the-contiguous-united-states

1126,,U.S. Department of Health & Human Services,,,The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) is a nationally representative public health surveillance system that has monitored drug related emergency department (ED) visits to hospitals since the early 1970s. First administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) the responsibility for DAWN now rests with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ). Over the years the exact survey methodology has been adjusted to improve the quality reliability and generalizability of the information produced by DAWN. The current approach was first fully implemented in the 2004 data collection year.    DAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample a hospital must be a non-Federal short-stay general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States with at least one 24-hour ED. DAWN cases are identified by the systematic review of ED medical records in participating hospitals. The unit of analysis is any ED visit involving recent drug use. DAWN captures both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. The reason a patient used a drug is not part of the criteria for considering a visit to be drug-related. Therefore all types of drug-related events are included drug misuse or abuse accidental drug ingestion drug-related suicide attempts malicious drug poisonings and adverse reactions. DAWN does not report medications that are unrelated to the visit.    The DAWN public-use dataset provides information for all types of drugs including illegal drugs prescription drugs over-the-counter medications dietary supplements anesthetic gases substances that have psychoactive effects when inhaled alcohol when used in combination with other drugs (all ages) and alcohol alone (only for patients aged 20 or younger). Public-use dataset variables describe and categorize up to 22 drugs contributing to the ED visit including toxicology confirmation and route of administration. Administrative variables specify the type of case case disposition categorized episode time of day and quarter of year.  Metropolitan area is included for represented metropolitan areas. Created variables include the number of unique drugs reported and case-level indicators for alcohol non-alcohol illicit substances any pharmaceutical non-medical use of pharmaceuticals and all misuse and abuse of drugs. Demographic items include age category sex and race/ethnicity. Complex sample design and weighting variables are included to calculate various estimates of drug-related ED visits for the Nation as a whole as well as for specific metropolitan areas from the ED visits classified as DAWN cases in the selected hospitals.This study has 1 Data Set.,HTML,,"[alcohol, demographic-charact..., detoxification, drug-overdose, drug-use, emergency-departments, energy-drinks, nonprescription-drugs, substance-abuse, suicide]",See this page for license information.,,,15,15,,,Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN-2011),2016-12-20,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2011

1138,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce",,,This archive covers two high resolution sea surface temperature (SST) analysis products developed using an optimum interpolation (OI) technique. The analyses have a spatial grid resolution of 0.25 degree and temporal resolution of 1 day. One product uses Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) infrared satellite data while the other uses satellite data from both AVHRR and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer from NASA Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). Both products also use sea-ice data in situ data from ships and buoys and include a large-scale adjustment of satellite biases with respect to the in situ data. Two products are needed because of the increase in signal variance from AMSR-E due to its near all-weather coverage. For both products the results show improved spatial and temporal resolution compared to heritage weekly 1.0 degree OISST analyses from the NWS NCEP. The AVHRR-only product uses Pathfinder AVHRR data when available from September 1981 through December 2005 and operational Navy AVHRR data for 2006 onwards. Pathfinder AVHRR was chosen because of good agreement with the in situ data. The combined AMSR-E and AVHRR product begins with the start of AMSR data in June 2002 and ends in October 2011 when the AMSR-E instrument ceased to function properly. In this second product the primary AVHRR contribution is in regions near land where AMSR-E is not available. However in cloud-free regions use of both infrared and microwave instruments reduces systematic biases because the error characteristics are independent. For both products in areas where sea ice is present SST is estimated from sea ice fraction datasets from NASA GSFC before 2005 and then from NWS NCEP from 2005 onwards. Preliminary products are produced daily in near real-time (1-day latency) and may be updated in the first few days if critical input data become available after the initial production time. After two weeks a complete or final product is generated with no additional changes expected.

1142,,State of Illinois,,,This dataset was compiled by the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA) at the request of the Governor’s Children’s Cabinet. This data contains the population of youth ages 13-26 in each county the total population of each county and the number and rate of index crimes reported with domestic violence offenses and rates reported separately for every year between 2006 and 2015.  For the purpose of this analysis the crime data was gathered from the Illinois State Police Annual report Crime in Illinois.  This publication is produced by the Illinois State Police every year using the UCR data that is submitted to them by individual jurisdictions throughout the state. The accuracy of this data presented is dependent on the local jurisdictions reporting their index crime and domestic violence offenses to ISP so it can be included in the annual report.   Therefore if there is large decrease in number of index crimes reported in the dataset it is likely that one or more jurisdictions did not report data for that year to ISP.  If there is a large increase from year to year within a county it is likely that a jurisdiction within the county who previously had not reported crime data did report crime data for that year.  If there is no reported crime in a certain year that means no jurisdictions or a small jurisdiction with no crime from that county reported data to the Illinois State Police. The annual Crime in Illinois reports can be found on the ISP website www.isp.state.il.us.  A direct link to that annual reports is http//www.isp.state.il.us/crime/ucrhome.cfm#anlrpts.  The Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority did not record the data that is expressed in the dataset.  ICJIA simply used the ISP reports to compile that yearly crime data into one chart that could be provided to the Illinois Governor’s Children’s Cabinet. This data set has be critically examined to be accurate according to the annual Crime in Illinois Reports.  If there are issues with the data set provided please contact the Illinois State Police or the individual jurisdictions within a specific county.  Index offenses do not include every crime event that occurs. Prior to 2014 there were 8 index crimes reported by the Illinois State Police in their annual reports Criminal Homicide Rape Robbery Aggravated Battery/Aggravated Assault Burglary Theft Motor Vehicle Theft and Arson.  In 2014 there were two new offenses added to the list of index crimes these were Human Trafficking – Commercial Sex Acts and Human Trafficking – Involuntary Servitude.  These are the index crimes that are recorded in the chart provided.  “Domestic offenses are defined as offenses committed between family or household members. Family or household members include spouses; former spouses; parents; children; foster parents; foster children; legal guardians and their wards; stepchildren; other persons related by blood (aunt uncle cousin) or by present or previous marriage (in-laws); persons who share or formerly shared a common dwelling; persons who have or allegedly have a child in common; persons who share or allegedly share a blood relationship through a child; persons who have or have had a dating or engagement relationship; and persons with disabilities their personal care assistants or care givers outside the context of an employee of a public or private care facility. Every offense that occurs when a domestic relationship exists between the victim and offender must be reported (Illinois State Police).”  “Offenses reported are not limited to domestic battery and violations of orders of protection; offenses most commonly associated with domestic violence (Illinois State Police).”  The crime rate was compiled using the total population and the index crime.  The Index crime whether all crime or Domestic Violence crime was divided by the total population then multiplied by 10000 hence crime rate per 10000.

1147,,Department of the Interior,,,"This dataset termed ""GAGES II"" an acronym for Geospatial Attributes of Gages for Evaluating Streamflow version II provides geospatial data and classifications for 9322 stream gages maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). It is an update to the original GAGES which was published as a Data Paper on the journal Ecology's website (Falcone and others 2010b) in 2010. The GAGES II dataset consists of gages which have had either 20+ complete years (not necessarily continuous) of discharge record since 1950 or are currently active as of water year 2009 and whose watersheds lie within the United States including Alaska Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Reference gages were identified based on indicators that they were the least-disturbed watersheds within the framework of broad regions based on 12 major ecoregions across the United States. Of the 9322 total sites 2057 are classified as reference and 7265 as non-reference. Of the 2057 reference sites 1633 have (through 2009) 20+ years of record since 1950. Some sites have very long flow records a number of gages have been in continuous service since 1900 (at least) and have 110 years of complete record (1900-2009) to date. The geospatial data include several hundred watershed characteristics compiled from national data sources including environmental features (e.g. climate â including historical precipitation geology soils topography) and anthropogenic influences (e.g. land use road density presence of dams canals or power plants). The dataset also includes comments from local USGS Water Science Centers based on Annual Data Reports pertinent to hydrologic modifications and influences. The data posted also include watershed boundaries in GIS format. This overall dataset is different in nature to the USGS Hydro-Climatic Data Network (HCDN; Slack and Landwehr 1992) whose data evaluation ended with water year 1988. The HCDN identifies stream gages which at some point in their history had periods which represented natural flow and the years in which those natural flows occurred were identified (i.e. not all HCDN sites were in reference condition even in 1988 for example 02353500). The HCDN remains a valuable indication of historic natural streamflow data. However the goal of this dataset was to identify watersheds which currently have near-natural flow conditions and the 2057 reference sites identified here were derived independently of the HCDN. A subset however noted in the BasinID worksheet as âHCDN-2009â has been identified as an updated list of 743 sites for potential hydro-climatic study. The HCDN-2009 sites fulfill all of the following criteria (a) have 20 years of complete and continuous flow record in the last 20 years (water years 1990-2009) and were thus also currently active as of 2009 (b) are identified as being in current reference condition according to the GAGES-II classification (c) have less than 5 percent imperviousness as measured from the NLCD 2006 and (d) were not eliminated by a review from participating state Water Science Center evaluators.

RWD boundaries delineate the service area (not incorporated area) of the district; municipal boundaries are generally the city limits included in the 2000 U.S. Census Bureau Tiger files although some municipal boundaries may be the actual water distribution system service area. PWWS district boundaries are the composite boundaries of the district members. Infrastructure includes the general location of the main pipelines in the distribution system; the source water wells and surface water intakes; facilities (storage tanks pump stations and surface water treatment plants); and interconnections between PWS systems for wholesale water distribution. These data were collected by the Kansas Rural Water Association (2004-2006) working directly with the public water supply systems using printed maps of the 1992 datasets.

1195,,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,,,Multivariate Time-Series (MTS) are ubiquitous and are generated in areas as disparate as sensor recordings in aerospace systems music and video streams medical monitoring and financial systems. Domain experts are often interested in searching for interesting multivariate patterns from these MTS databases which can contain up to several gigabytes of data. Surprisingly research on MTS search is very limited. Most existing work only supports queries with the same length of data or queries on a fixed set of variables. In this paper we propose an efficient and flexible subsequence search framework for massive MTS databases that for the first time enables querying on any subset of variables with arbitrary time delays between them. We propose two provably correct algorithms to solve this problem — (1) an R-tree Based Search (RBS) which uses Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBR) to organize the subsequences and (2) a List Based Search (LBS) algorithm which uses sorted lists for indexing. We demonstrate the performance of these algorithms using two large MTS databases from the aviation domain each containing several millions of observations. Both these tests show that our algorithms have very high prune rates (>95%) thus needing actual disk access for only less than 5% of the observations. To the best of our knowledge this is the first flexible MTS search algorithm capable of subsequence search on any subset of variables. Moreover MTS subsequence search has never been attempted on datasets of the size we have used in this paper.,ZIP,,"[ames, dashlink, nasa]",U.S. Government Work,,,15,15,,,Multivariate Time Series Search,2011-08-15T14:14:21,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/multivariate-time-series-search

1206,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce",,,"Ionograms are recorded tracings of reflected high frequency radio pulses generated by an ionosonde. Unique relationships exist between the sounding frequency and the ionization densities which can reflect it. As the sounder sweeps from lower to higher frequencies the signal rises above the noise of commercial radio sources and records the return signal reflected from the different layers of the ionosphere. These echoes form characteristic patterns of                        ""traces"" that comprise the ionogram. Radio pulses travel more slowly within the ionosphere than in free space therefore the apparent or ""virtual"" height is recorded instead of a true height. For frequencies approaching the level of maximum plasma frequency in a layer the virtual height tends to infinity because the pulse must travel a finite distance at effectively zero speed. The frequencies at which this occurs are called the critical frequencies. Characteristic values                        of virtual heights (designated as h'E h'F and h'F2 etc.) and critical frequencies (designated as foE foF1 and foF2 etc.) of each layer are scaled manually or by computer from these ionograms. Typically an ionosonde station obtains one ionogram recording every 15 minutes. When the scaling is done manually only the hourly recordings are routinely reduced to numerical data. Modern ionosondes with computer-driven automatic scaling procedures routinely scale all the                        ionograms recorded. The resulting numerical values along with the original ionograms and station reports are archived at five World Data Centers (WDCs) for Ionosphere. The ionosphere is divided into four broad regions called DE F and topside. These regions may be further divided into several regularly occurring layers such as F1 or F2.D Region The region between about 75 and 95km above the Earth in which the relatively weak) ionization is mainly responsible for                        absorption of high-frequency radio waves. E Region The region between about 95 and 150km above the Earth that marks the height of the regular daytime E layer. Other subdivisions isolating separate layers of irregular occurrence within this region are also labeled with an E prefix such as the thick layer E2 and a highly variable thin layer Sporadic E. Ions in this region are mainly O2+. F Region The region above about 150km in which the important reflecting layer F2 is                        found. Other layers within this region are also described using the prefix F such as a temperate-latitude regular stratification F1 and a low-latitude semi-regular stratification F1.5.

Glenn Research Center management is reviewing the availability requirements for these software packages. We are working with Center management to get the review completed and issues resolved in a timely manner. We will post updates on this website when the issues are resolved. We apologize for any inconvenience. Please contact Jonathan Litt jonathan.s.litt@nasa.gov if you have any questions in the meantime.  Subject Area        Engine Health  Description        This data set was generated with the C-MAPSS simulator. C-MAPSS stands for 'Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation' and it is a tool for the simulation of realistic large commercial turbofan engine data. Each flight is a combination of a series of flight conditions with a reasonable linear transition period to allow the engine to change from one flight condition to the next. The flight conditions are arranged to cover a typical ascent from sea level to 35K ft and descent back down to sea level. The fault was injected at a given time in one of the flights and persists throughout the remaining flights effectively increasing the age of the engine. The intent is to identify which flight and when in the flight the fault occurred.  How Data Was Acquired        The data provided is from a high fidelity system level engine simulation designed to simulate nominal and fault engine degradation over a series of flights. The simulated data was created with a Matlab Simulink tool called C-MAPSS.  Sample Rates and Parameter Description        The flights are full flight recordings sampled at 1 Hz and consist of 30 engine and flight condition parameters.

1253,,Department of Homeland Security,,,Hurricane Evacuation Routes in the United States A hurricane evacuation route is a designated route used to direct traffic inland in case of a hurricane threat. This dataset is based on supplied data from gulf coast and Atlantic seaboard states. Each state was contacted by TGS to determine an official source for hurricane evacuation routes. GIS data was gathered from states willing to share such data. In cases where states were unable or unwilling to share data in this format TGS requested that the states provide a source for identifying hurricane evacuation routes. The states usually identified a website that made this data available to the public. Three (3) states (ME NY and NH) indicated that they do not maintain public maps showing hurricane evacuation routes and were unable or unwilling to share GIS files depicting such routes. Hurricane evacuation routes depicted on non-GIS maps were digitized using aerial ortho imagery while referencing supplied maps. Shape files that depicted hurricane evacuation routes were edge matched and merged with the digitized evacuation routes. All routes identified as primary hurricane evacuation routes were included in this dataset. If a state also designated secondary hurricane evacuation routes they were included as well. Routes depicted in this dataset are dependent upon what each state identified as a hurricane evacuation route. Criteria used to identify these routes may vary from state to state.,HTML,,"[geospatial, imagery, infrastructure, location, map]",No license information was provided.

1262,,Montgomery County of Maryland,,,The Licensure & Regulatory Services Program inspects all licensed retail food establishments in Montgomery County for a variety of reasons (e.g. obtaining a permit regular check-ups or in response to complaints.) Included in this overall surveillance are two types of inspections that are conducted on a routine basis. The first type a comprehensive inspection is a thorough inspection that evaluates the sanitation maintenance and food service operations for the facility. This inspection includes many of the items found in the monitoring inspection such as critical temperatures and food handling procedures. The second type a monitoring inspection involves checking the food service operation for critical food temperatures equipment temperatures and general food handling / cleanliness practices. While monitoring inspections are not as detailed as environmental inspections they help ensure that the facility is operating safely throughout the year.  The frequency of inspections is based on the food-borne illness risks associated with the food being processed at a facility. Based on the risk each facility is designated as high medium or low priority. High priority risk facilities prepare food products a day or more in advance or utilize any combination of two or more processes such as a cooking cooling reheating and hot holding food over four hours. Moderate priority risk facilities prepare and cook food products which are served immediately or within four hours. A low priority risk facility serve prepackage foods that are not potentially hazardous.  For high risk facilities a monitoring inspection is conducted at least twice a year and moderate risk facilities are inspected at least once a year. High and moderate risk facilities also receive at least one comprehensive inspection every year. Low risk priority facilities typically receive one comprehensive inspection every two years.  (C) Denotes a Critical Violation. A Critical Violation means a food safety requirement that requires immediate correction.

1281,,Department of the Interior,,,This data set provides industrial-scale onshore wind turbine locations corresponding facility information and turbine technical specifications in the United States to March 2014. The database has nearly 49000 wind turbine records that have been collected digitized locationally verified and internally quality assured and quality controlled. Turbines from the Federal Aviation Administration Digital Obstacle File product date March 2 2014 were used as the primary source of turbine data points. Verification of the position of turbines was done by visual interpretation using high-resolution aerial imagery in ESRI ArcGIS Desktop. Turbines without Federal Aviation Administration Obstacle Repository System (FAA ORS) numbers were visually identified and supplemental points were added to the collection. A locational error of plus or minus 10 meters for turbine positions was estimated. Wind farm facility names were identified from publicly available facility data sets. Facility names were then used in a web search of additional industry publications and press releases to attribute additional turbine information (such as manufacturer model and technical specifications of wind turbines). Wind farm facility location data from various wind and energy industry sources were used to search for and digitize turbines not in existing databases. Technical specifications assigned to were based on the make and model as described in literature in the Federal Aviation Administration Digital Obstacle File and information from the turbine manufacturers' websites. Some facility and turbine information did not exist or was difficult to obtain. Thus uncertainty may be present. That uncertainty was rated and a confidence was recorded for both location and attribution data quality.,ZIP,,"[wyoming, colorado, energy, washington, dataset, tennessee, north carolina, wisconsin, turbine, nevada, maine, montana, north dakota, mississippi, south dakota, gis, hawaii, shapefile, oklahoma, delaware, minnesota, windfarm, illinois, nebraska, arkansas, indiana, maryland, louisiana, idaho, arizona, iowa, west virginia, michigan, kansas, utah, virginia, oregon, wind facility, connecticut, wind farm, california, massachusetts, geospatial datasets, new york, rhode island, renewable, vermont, georgia, pennsylvania, florida, alaska, kentucky, data set, new jersey, new mexico, district of columbia, new hampshire, texas, missouri, south carolina, ohio, alabama, wind, wind turbine]",No license information was provided.

This study evaluates long-term cumulative depletion volumes in 40 separate aquifers or areas and one land use category in the United States bringing together information from the literature and from new analyses. Depletion is directly calculated using calibrated groundwater models analytical approaches or volumetric budget analyses for multiple aquifer systems. Estimated groundwater depletion in the United States during 1900â2008 totals approximately 1000 cubic kilometers (km3). Furthermore the rate of groundwater depletion has increased markedly since about 1950 with maximum rates occurring during the most recent period (2000â2008) when the depletion rate averaged almost 25 km3 per year (compared to 9.2 km3 per year averaged over the 1900â2008 timeframe).,ZIP,,"[new mexico middle r..., arizona antelope va..., mississippi embayment, wyoming, groundwater withdrawal, death valley, texas gulf coast, denver basin, columbia plateau aq..., nevada pecos river ..., alluvial basins, aquifer, western alluvial ba..., atlantic coastal plain, snake river plateau, new mexico and texa..., california coachell..., nevada, colorado, western volcanic aq..., south dakota, nevada los angeles ..., new mexico milford ..., new jersey, midwest cambrian-or..., oklahoma, delaware, water level, texas san luis valley, north carolina, high plains aquifer, environment, nebraska, california pahvant ..., oahu, hawaii, new mexico hueco bo..., northern great plains, maryland, utah paradise valley, idaho, northeast florida, california and neva..., groundwater depletion, new mexico mojave r..., black mesa area, arizona, midwest cambrian-or..., western volcanic aq..., kansas, utah, virginia, wells, snake river plain, water, colorado tularosa b..., regionnal flow system, new mexico, dakota aquifer, western volcanic sy..., california mesilla ..., deep confined aquifers, central valley cali..., inlandwaters, georgia, deep confined bedro..., long island, new york, gulf coast plain, california death va..., antelope valley cal..., utah estancia basin, united staes, groundwater, south carolina, utah mimbres basin, texas, high plains (ogalla..., coastal lowlands]",No license information was provided.

1305,,State of Arkansas,,,"911 Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) service area boundaries in Arkansas According to the National Emergency Number Association (NENA) a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) is a facility equipped and staffed to receive 9-1-1 calls. The service area is the geographic area within which a 911 call placed using a landline is answered at the associated PSAP. This dataset only includes primary PSAPs. Secondary PSAPs backup PSAPs and wireless PSAPs have been excluded from this dataset. Primary PSAPs receive calls directly whereas secondary PSAPs receive calls that have been transferred by a primary PSAP. Backup PSAPs provide service in cases where another PSAP is inoperable. Most military bases have their own emergency telephone systems. To connect to such system from within a military base it may be necessary to dial a number other than 9 1 1. Due to the sensitive nature of military installations TGS did not actively research these systems. If civilian authorities in surrounding areas volunteered information about these systems or if adding a military PSAP was necessary to fill a hole in civilian provided data TGS included it in this dataset. Otherwise military installations are depicted as being covered by one or more adjoining civilian emergency telephone systems. In some cases areas are covered by more than one PSAP boundary. In these cases any of the applicable PSAPs may take a 911 call. Where a specific call is routed may depend on how busy the applicable PSAPS are (i.e. load balancing) operational status (i.e. redundancy) or time of date / day of week. If an area does not have 911 service TGS included that area in the dataset along with the address and phone number of their dispatch center. These are areas where someone must dial a 7 or 10 digit number to get emergency services. These records can be identified by a ""Y"" in the [NON911EMNO] field. This indicates that dialing 911 inside one of these areas does not connect one with emergency services. This dataset was constructed by gathering information about PSAPs from state level officials. In some cases this was geospatial information in others it was tabular. This information was supplemented with a list of PSAPs from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Each PSAP was researched to verify its tabular information. In cases where the source data was not geospatial each PSAP was researched to determine its service area in terms of existing boundaries (e.g. city and county boundaries). In some cases existing boundaries had to be modified to reflect coverage areas (e.g. âentire county north of Country Road 30â). However there may be cases where minor deviations from existing boundaries are not reflected in this dataset such as the case where a particular PSAPs coverage area includes an entire county and the homes and businesses along a road which is partly in another county.

1307,,Department of Energy,,,NREL's Geographic Information System (GIS) team offers both a national wind resource assessment of the United States and high-resolution wind data. The national wind resource assessment was created for the U.S. Department of Energy in 1986 by the Pacific Northwest Laboratory and is documented in the Wind Energy Resource Atlas of the United States October 1986. This national wind resource data provides an estimate of the annual average wind resource for the conterminous United States with a resolution of 1/3 degree of latitude by 1/4 degree of longitude.  The wind resource assessment was based on surface wind data coastal marine area data and upper-air data where applicable. In data-sparse areas three qualitative indicators of wind speed or power were used when applicable topographic/meteorological indicators (e.g. gorges mountain summits sheltered valleys); wind deformed vegetation; and eolian landforms (e.g. playas sand dunes). The data was evaluated at a regional level to produce 12 regional wind resource assessments; the regional assessments were then incorporated into the national wind resource assessment.  The conterminous United States was divided into grid cells 1/4 degree of latitude by 1/3 degree of longitude. Each grid cell was assigned a wind power class ranging from 1 to 6 with 6 being the windiest. The wind power density limits for each wind power class are shown in Table 1-1. Each grid cell contains sites of varying power class. The assigned wind power class is representative of the range of wind power densities likely to occur at exposed sites within the grid cell. Hilltops ridge crests mountain summits large clearings and other locations free of local obstruction to the wind will be well exposed to the wind. In contrast locations in narrow valleys and canyons downwind of hills or obstructions or in forested or urban areas are likely to have poor wind exposure.,HTML,,"[energy-resources, renewable-energy, resource-map, wind-energy]",Creative Commons Attribution,,,13,13,,,Wind Energy Resource Data,2014-02-27T20:15:16.867982,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/wind-energy-resource-data-fc121

The sighting reports came from a variety of federal State and municipal agencies public utilities universities engineering and private consultant firms and businesses. The concern caused by the explosive spread of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) within the United States resulted in passage of the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990. The impact of this biofouling pest on the economy and ecological processes in the U.S. and Canada has required prompt action on a large scale to prevent further infestations and minimize ecological degradation.

1335,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce",,,"Climate change impacts have been identified as one of the greatest global threats to coral reef ecosystems. As temperature rise mass bleaching and infectious disease outbreaks are likely to become more frequent.   In 2016 the following projects will take place to monitor the effects of thermal stress and asses coral bleaching  Florida Keys Bleach Watch The Florida Keys Bleach Watch program is designed to train and coordinate volunteers who regularly report on the occurrence (or absence) of coral bleaching and basic environmental conditions of the reef. The observational data from Bleach Watch volunteers is synthesized with existing NOAA's ""Coral Reef Watch"" and ""Coral Health and Monitoring"" programs which have developed remote sensing analysis and real-time Monitoring data products for predicting when conditions are favorable for coral bleaching. This information is then provided to resource managers with NOAA DOI and the State in the form of ""Current Conditions"" reports distributed throughout the warm summer months.  Coral Reef Watch Satellite- and Model-Based Products for Coral Reef Ecosystem Managers Coral Reef Watch utilizes satellite in-situ and modeled data to provide a decision support system (DSS) to help managers and other stakeholders worldwide prepare for and effectively respond to coral reef ecosystem environmental stressors (climate- and terrestrial-input). This work builds on CRWâs current near-real-time DSS and previous development efforts and includes manager feedback from numerous workshops training sessions and user meetings to further develop/enhance CRW's next-generation 5km satellite tools bleaching outlooks based on operational climate forecasts and new products combining light and heat stresses. During FY16 CRW will focus primarily on continued development/enhancement of its 5km satellite-based products probabilistic bleaching outlooks based on NCEPâs operational CFS model and new Light Stress Damage products further preparing each for transition-to-operations by NOAA. Along with assisting analyses of climate change impacts on coral reefs (e.g. bleaching disease mortality) these tools help managers better conserve coral reefs (supporting resilience efforts) and prepare for/prioritize resources for events (e.g. mass coral bleaching or disease) that could have long-term ecologically-significant impacts on coral reef health and function.  Observing and Documenting Predicted 2015/2016 Mass Coral Bleaching Events in Hawaii We will conduct surveys on five of the eight main Hawaiian Islands to document the coral bleaching associated with the projected 2015/2016 El Nino warming. We will task a towed-diver survey team of four researchers to cost-effectively document up to 12 km of reef per survey day covering the reefs of Molokai Lanai Maui and Hawaii islands in a collaborative cruise aboard the NOAA ship Hiâialakai and Oahu's from shore. We will follow bleaching recovery using satellite imagery from SkyBox Imaging. These surveys will complement ongoing work with collaborators and fill an unaddressed need for broad-scale bleaching monitoring in the state.   The Coral Reef Temperature Anomaly Database    The Coral Reef Temperature Anomaly Database (CoRTAD) quantifies thermal stress conditions on coral reefs around the world (1982-2012). Through annual updates and ongoing improvements to its content and accessibility CoRTAD establishes a baseline for coral reef thermal conditions and reveals changes in those conditions through time. A new reprocessing of the underlying AVHRR Pathfinder dataset is now scheduled for completion during FY16. This new version of Pathfinder known as v5.3 if available with sufficient lead time will be used in a new CoRTAD version 6 production run which will extend the dataset to include data from 2013.  In FY16 an experimental nighttime-only version of CoRTAD will be completed to support other CRCP efforts. This project will continue to achieve and make available the most accurate most complete and finest resolution global collection of thermal stress and related environmental information for coral managers researchers and tool developers.

Two types of congestion estimates are produced every ten minutes 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimate by traffic segments gives the observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic.  Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O’Hare airport area).    This dataset contains the current estimated speed for about 1250 segments covering 300 miles of arterial roads.    There is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors including but not limited to frequent    intersections traffic signals transit movements availability of alternative routes crashes short length of the segments etc. speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates    together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.,CSV,,"[sustainability, traffic]",No license information was provided.,,,13,13,,,Chicago Traffic Tracker - Congestion Estimates by Segments,2018-02-22,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/chicago-traffic-tracker-congestion-estimates-by-segments-0b9d7

The following data sources (and layers) are contained in this service USEPA's 2005 National-Scale Air Toxic Assessment (NATA) data. Data are shown at the census tract level (2000 census tract boundaries US Census Bureau) for Cumulative Cancer and Non-Cancer risks (Neurological and Respiratory) from 139 air toxics. In addition individual pollutant estimates of Ambient Concentration Exposure Concentration Cancer and Non-Cancer risks (Neurological and Respiratory) are provided for Acetaldehyde Acrolein Arsenic Benzene 13-Butadiene Chromium Diesel PM Formaldehyde Lead Naphthalene and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH). The original Access tables were downloaded from USEPA's Office of Air and Radiation (OAR) http//www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/nata2005/tables.html. The data classification (defined interval) for this map service was developed for USEPA's Office of Research and Development's (ORD) Community-Focused Exposure and Risk Screening Tool (C-FERST) per guidance provided by OAR. The 2005 NATA provides information on 177 of the 187 Clean Air Act air toxics (http//www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/nata2005/05pdf/2005polls.pdf) plus diesel particulate matter (diesel PM was assessed for non-cancer only). For additional information about NATA go to http//www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/nata2005/05pdf/nata_tmd.pdf or contact Ted Palma USEPA (palma.ted@epa.gov). NATA data disclaimer USEPA strongly cautions that these modeling results are most meaningful when viewed at the state or national level and should not be used to draw conclusions about local exposures or risks (e.g. to compare local areas to identify the exact location of ""hot spots"" or to revise or design emission reduction programs). Substantial uncertainties with the input data for these models may cause the results to misrepresent actual risks especially at the census tract level. However we believe the census tract data and maps can provide a useful approximation of geographic patterns of variation in risk within counties. For example a cluster of census tracts with higher estimated risks may suggest the existence of a ""hot spot"" although the specific tracts affected will be uncertain. More refined assessments based on additional data and analysis would be needed to better characterize such risks at the tract level. (http//www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/nata2005/countyxls/cancer_risk02_county_042009.xls). Note that these modeled estimates are derived from outdoor sources only; indoor sources are not included in these examples but may be significant in some cases. The modeled exposure estimates are for a median individual in the geographic area shown. Note that in some cases the estimated relationship between human exposure and health effect may be calculated as a high end estimate and thus may be more likely to overestimate than underestimate actual health effects for the median individual in the geographic area shown. Other limitations to consider when looking at the results are detailed on the EPA 2005 NATA website. For these reasons the NATA maps included in C-FERST are provided for screening purposes only. See the 2005 National Air Toxic Assessment website for recommended usage and limitations on the estimated cancer and noncancer data provided above. USEPA's NonAttainment areas data. C-FERST displays Ozone for 8-hour Ozone based on the 1997 standard for reporting and Particulate Matter PM-2.5 based on the 2006 standard for reporting.

1403,,U.S. Department of Health & Human Services,,,"The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) series (formerly titled National Household Survey on Drug Abuse) primarily measures the prevalence and correlates of drug use in the United States. The surveys are designed to provide quarterly as well as annual estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs alcohol and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime annual and past-month usage for the following drug classes marijuana cocaine (and crack) hallucinogens heroin inhalants alcohol tobacco and nonmedical use of prescription drugs including pain relievers tranquilizers stimulants and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts health care access and coverage illegal activities and arrest record problems resulting from the use of drugs and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2010 survey including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These ""youth experiences"" items covered a variety of topics such as neighborhood environment illegal activities drug use by friends social support extracurricular activities exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and access to care perceived risk of using drugs perceived availability of drugs driving and personal behavior and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008 a split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems.

The data types to be collected include bathymetric and topographic lidar point data down-looking aerial imagery and hyperspectral imagery. The collection effort will follow the coastline and extend 500m inland and 1000m offshore or to bathymetric lidar extinction whichever comes first. Topographic lidar data will have a nominal sub-meter post-spacing. Where water conditions permit the bathymetric lidar data will have nominal 2m x 2m postings. Vertical accuracy of the topographic lidar data will meet or exceed RMSEZ=15 cm. Bathymetric lidar data will have a vertical accuracy of 30 cm 2-sigma. The aerial imagery will have a pixel size approximately 20cm and the hyperspectral imagery will be provided in 1m pixels containing 36 spectral bands between 375 - 1050 nm with 19 nm bandwidth. The data will be collected on the NAD83 ellipsoid using NGS published monuments as control. Final data will be tied horizontally to NAD83 (NSRS 2007) in geographic coordinates. Vertical measurements will be converted from NAD83 ellipsoid heights in meters to NAVD88 orthometric heights using the current Geoid model at the time of acquisition. Data products from this survey effort will include topographic and bathymetric lidar point clouds in LAS format an NAVD88 0m shoreline contour and a series of raster data products including topo/bathy digital elevation models (DEMs) true-color aerial image mosaics hyperspectral image mosaics laser reflectance images and basic landcover classification images. Images of water column properties (i.e. chlorophyll and CDOM concentrations) will also be generated.

The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts however each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. The primary legal divisions of most States are termed counties. In Louisiana these divisions are known as parishes. In Alaska which has no counties the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs city and boroughs and municipalities and for the unorganized area census areas. The latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau. In four States (Maryland Missouri Nevada and Virginia) there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their States. These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation. The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation. The Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation Municipios in Puerto Rico Districts and Islands in American Samoa Municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and Islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The entire area of the United States Puerto Rico and the Island Areas is covered by counties or equivalent entities.

To improve our capacity for data analysis while providing the most efficient and the highest quality health care to our Veteran patients VHA working with the VA Office of Information and Technology implemented a health data warehouse.  Central to this plan is consolidating data from disparate sources into a coherent single logical data model.  The Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) is the physical implementation of this logical data model at the enterprise level for VHA.   Although the CDW initially began to store data as early as 2006 a renewed effort began in 2010 to accelerate CDW's content by including more subject areas from Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) and content from other existing national data systems.  CDW supports fully developed subject areas in its production environment as well as supporting rapid prototyping by extracting data directly from source systems with very minor data transformations.

The resulting network of land survey lines divided the state into townships ranges sections quarter sections quarter-quarter sections and government lots and laid the groundwork for contemporary land ownership patterns. The township range and section boundaries were digitized at MnGeo (formerly known as the Land Management Information Center - LMIC) from stable base mylars of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 30-minute latitude by 60-minute longitude map series (1100000-scale). All survey lines were extended across water bodies despite the fact that U.S. Geological Survey base maps depict them only on land. This addition allows all sections and townships to be represented as closed areas (polygons) ensuring that township and range location can be determined for any point in the state.

Participants are given three-dimensional models (measuring cups and spoons a ruler and two household spoons) and/or USDA's Food Model Booklet (containing drawings of various sizes of glasses mugs bowls mounds circles and other measures) to estimate food amounts. WWEIA data are collected using USDA's dietary data collection instrument the Automated Multiple-Pass Method (AMPM). The AMPM is a fully computerized method for collecting 24-hour dietary recalls either in-person or by telephone.     For each 2-year data release cycle the following dietary intake data files are available    Individual Foods File - Contains one record per food for each survey participant. Foods are identified by USDA food codes. Each record contains information about when and where the food was consumed whether the food was eaten in combination with other foods amount eaten and amounts of nutrients provided by the food.    Total Nutrient Intakes File - Contains one record per day for each survey participant. Each record contains daily totals of food energy and nutrient intakes daily intake of water intake day of week total number foods reported and whether intake was usual much more than usual or much less than usual. The Day 1 file also includes salt use in cooking and at the table; whether on a diet to lose weight or for other health-related reason and type of diet; and frequency of fish and shellfish consumption (examinees one year or older Day 1 file only).    DHHS is responsible for the sample design and data collection and USDA is responsible for the survey’s dietary data collection methodology maintenance of the databases used to code and process the data and data review and processing. USDA also funds the collection and processing of Day 2 dietary intake data which are used to develop variance estimates and calculate usual nutrient intakes.,HTML,,"[ampm, automated-multiple-..., choline, dietary-intake, energy-intakes, food-components, food-energy, meals, nhanes, np107, nutrient-intakes, snacks, vitamin-b12, vitamin-d, vitamin-e, what-we-eat-in-america, wweia]",Creative Commons CCZero,,,12,12,,,What We Eat In America (WWEIA) Database,2017-12-11,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/what-we-eat-in-america-wweia-database

The DEM data are stored as a series of profiles in which the spacing of the elevations along and between each profile is in regular whole number intervals. The normal orientation of data is by columns and rows. Each column contains a series of elevations ordered from south to north with the order of the columns from west to east. The DEM is formatted as one ASCII header record (A- record) followed by a series of profile records (B- records) each of which include a short B-record header followed by a series of ASCII integer elevations per each profile. The last physical record of the DEM is an accuracy record (C-record). 7.5-minute DEM (30- by 30-m data spacing cast on Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection).

1465,,Department of the Interior,,,This raster data set represents water-level change in the High Plains aquifer of the United States from 2005 to 2009 in feet. The High Plains aquifer underlies 112.6 million acres (176000 square miles) in parts of eight States Colorado Kansas Nebraska New Mexico Oklahoma South Dakota Texas and Wyoming. The aquifer's saturated thickness ranges from near zero to about 1200 feet (Weeks and Gutentag 1981). Water-level declines occurred in parts of the High Plains aquifer soon after the onset of substantial increases in irrigation with groundwater (about 1950) (Luckey and others 1981; Gutentag and others 1984). This data set was generated in ESRI ArcInfo Workstation Version 9.3 which is a geographic information system (GIS) using water-level-change data from wells measured in 2005 and 2009 and from some additional wells in New Mexico which were measured in 2006 2007 and 2008. For this data set areas of no substantial change were designated as areas where water-level change was between a rise of 1 foot and a decline of 1 foot; the raster was set to zero in the areas of no substantial change.

The primary legal divisions of most states are termed counties. In Louisiana these divisions are known as parishes. In Alaska which has no counties the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs city and boroughs municipalities and for the unorganized area census areas. The latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau. In four states (Maryland Missouri Nevada and Virginia) there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their states. These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation. The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation.

Two Phase 2 model experiments were run.  First a set of selected  biogeochemical models and coupled biogeochemical-biogeographical models were run from 1895 to 1993 to compare model responses to the historical time series and current ecosystem biogeochemistry.  Second these same models were run on the projected 1994 to 2100 data to compare their ecological responses to transient scenarios of climate and atmospheric CO2 change. Model runs were performed for daily monthly and annual gridded data sets. The output of the annual model runs in VEMAP grid format are contained in this data set.

This dataset includes 2013 2014 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5) health outcomes (13) and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Division of Population Health Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2013 2014) Census Bureau 2010 census population data and American Community Survey (ACS) 2009-2013 2010-2014 estimates.

1535,,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,,,We present a set of novel algorithms which we call sequenceMiner that detect and characterize anomalies in large sets of high-dimensional symbol sequences that arise from recordings of switch sensors in the cockpits of commercial airliners. While the algorithms we present are general and domain-independent we focus on a specific    problem that is critical to determining system-wide health    of a fleet of aircraft. The approach taken uses unsupervised clustering of sequences using the normalized length of he longest common subsequence (nLCS) as a similarity measure followed by a detailed analysis of outliers to detect anomalies. In this method an outlier sequence is defined as a sequence that is far away from a cluster. We present new algorithms for outlier analysis that provide comprehensible indicators as to why a particular sequence is deemed to be an outlier. The algorithm provides a coherent description to an analyst of the anomalies in the sequence when compared to more normal sequences.  The final section of the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of sequenceMiner for anomaly detection on a real set of discrete sequence data from a fleet of commercial airliners.  We show that sequenceMiner discovers actionable and    operationally significant safety events.

The geodatabases do not contain any sensitive data. The                         2015 TIGER Geodatabases are designed for use with Esriâs ArcGIS.                   The 2015 State Geodatabase for California contains multiple layers. These layers are the Block Block Group Census Designated Place Census Tract County Subdivision and                 Incorporated Place layers.                  Block Groups (BGs) are clusters of blocks within the same census tract. Each census tract contains at least one BG and BGs are uniquely numbered                 within census tracts.  BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same                 decennial census.  For example tabulation blocks numbered 3001 3002 3003.. 3999 within census tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that                 census tract.  BGs coded 0 are intended to only include water area no land area and they are generally in territorial seas coastal water and                 Great Lakes water areas. Block groups generally contain  between 600 and 3000 people.  A BG usually covers a contiguous area but never crosses                 county or census tract boundaries. They may however cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions places urban                 areas voting districts congressional districts and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas.                   The BG boundaries in this release are those that were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for the                 2010 Census.                    The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to                 previous decennial censuses.  Census tracts generally have a population size between 1200 and 8000 people with an optimum size of 4000 people.                 When first delineated census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics economic status and living                 conditions.  The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.  Physical changes in street patterns caused by                 highway construction new development and so forth may require boundary revisions.  In addition census tracts occasionally are split due to                 population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline.  Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable                 features.  They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to                 allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.  State and                 county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy.  In a few rare instances a census tract may                 consist of noncontiguous areas.  These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities                 that are themselves noncontiguous.  For the 2010 Census the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that                 include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American                 Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little                 or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park military installation or a business/industrial                 park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area no land area.                    An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD)                 which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard necessarily to population.  Places always nest within a state                 but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries.  An incorporated place usually is a city town village or borough but can have                 other legal descriptions.  CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places.  CDPs are delineated                 to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state                 in which they are located.  The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with state local and/or tribal officials and usually coincide                 with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity.  CDP boundaries often change from one decennial                 census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily                 have the same boundary.  The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs is that they must contain some housing and population.                    The boundaries of most incorporated places in this shapefile are as of January 1 2013 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and                 Annexation Survey (BAS).  Limited updates that occurred after January 1 2013 such as newly incorporated places are also included.  The boundaries                 of all CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for the 2010 Census.                  The primary legal divisions of most states are termed counties.  In Louisiana these divisions are known as parishes.  In Alaska which has no                 counties the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs city and boroughs municipalities and for the unorganized area census areas.  The                 latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau.  In four states (Maryland Missouri                 Nevada and Virginia) there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary                 divisions of their states.  These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data                 presentation.  The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data                 presentation.  The Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation Municipios in Puerto                 Rico Districts and Islands in American Samoa Municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and Islands in the U.S. Virgin                 Islands.  The entire area of the United States Puerto Rico and the Island Areas is covered by counties or equivalent entities.                    The boundaries for counties and equivalent entities are mostly as of January 1 2013 primarily as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and                 Annexation Survey (BAS).  However some changes made after January 2013 including the addition and deletion of counties are included.                  County subdivisions are the primary divisions of counties and their equivalent entities for the reporting of Census Bureau data. They include                 legally-recognized minor civil divisions (MCDs) and statistical census county divisions (CCDs) and unorganized territories.  For the 2010 Census                 the MCDs are the primary governmental and/or administrative divisions of counties in 29 States and Puerto Rico; Tennessee changed from having CCDs                 for Census 2000 to having MCDs for the 2010 Census.  In MCD States where no MCD exists or is not defined the Census Bureau creates statistical                 unorganized territories to complete coverage.  The entire area of the United States Puerto Rico and the Island Areas are covered by county                 subdivisions.  The boundaries of most legal MCDs are as of January 1 2013 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey                 (BAS).

1571,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce",,,The National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) was produced by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory under the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. The NSRDB update is a collection of hourly values of the three most common measurements of solar radiation (i.e. global horizontal direct normal and diffuse horizontal) over a period of time adequate to establish means and extremes and at a sufficient number or locations to represent regional solar radiation climates. Nearly all of the solar data in the NSRDB are modeled and only 40 sites have measured solar data - none of them with a complete period of record. Because of the data-filling methods used to accomplish the goal of serial completeness NSRDB meteorological data are not suitable for climatological work. The meteorological fields in the NSRDB should be used only as ancillary data for solar deployment and sizing applications. Filled/interpolated meteorological data should not be used for climatic applications. (All such data are flagged.) The serially complete hourly data provided in the NSRDB update are provided in two output formats 1) ground-based solar and meteorological dataset and 2) 10 km gridded output produced by the SUNY model. The 1991-2010 NSRDB is an update of the 1991-2005 NSRDB released in 2006 and archived at NCDC. The updated NSRDB dataset an hourly ground-based data set of solar and meteorological fields for 1454 stations. The primary provider for ground-based data is NCDC which are stored as site-year files in comma-separated value (CSV) American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) format. Station identification numbers use the six-digit United States Air Force (USAF) station ID numbering scheme. The measured solar radiation data came from multiple sources including Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program Department of Energy Florida Solar Energy Center State of Florida Integrated Surface Irradiance Study and Surface Radiation Budget Measurement Networks National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Air Resources Laboratory and Earth System Research Laboratory Global Monitoring Division Measurement and Instrumentation Data Center National Renewable Energy Laboratory University of Oregon Solar Radiation Monitoring Laboratory Network University of Texas Solar Energy Laboratory. All meteorological data were provided by the National Climatic Data Center from its Integrated Surface Hourly Database (ISD) product. The NSRDB Statistics Files hold summary statistics for all Class I and Class II stations. The Daily Statistics provide monthly and annual averages of solar radiation and several meteorological parameters for both annual and a 20 year roll-up. The Hourly Statistics provide average diurnal profiles by hour for each station year for each solar parameter. The Persistence Statistics provide multiple levels of persistence for up to 30 days for each station for each solar parameter.

This approach was first developed for South America (Sayre et al. 2008) and is now being implemented globally (Sayre et al. 2007). Unique physical environments were delineated from a massive biophysical stratification of the nation into the major structural components of ecosystems biogeographic regions (Cress et al. 2008c) land surface forms (Cress et al. 2008a) surficial lithology (Cress et al. 2008d) and topographic moisture potential (Cress et al. 2008b). Each of these structural components was mapped for the contiguous United States and then spatially combined to produce ecosystem structural footprints which represented unique abiotic (physical) environments.

To download a PDF version of the Level IV ecoregion map and legend go to ftp//ftp.epa.gov/wed/ecoregions/us/Eco_Level_IV_US_pg.pdf. Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type quality and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research assessment management and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies state agencies and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena including geology physiography vegetation climate soils land use wildlife and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 52 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group 1997). At Level III the continental United States contains 104 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 85 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2005). Level IV ecoregions (n = 968) are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995 2004) Omernik and others (2000) and Gallant and others (1989).

This is one of a set of three surveys (at the district school and teacher levels) that collected data on a range of educational technology resources. The study was conducted using surveys via the web or by mail. Telephone follow-up for survey non-response and data clarification was also used. Questionnaires and cover letters for the teacher survey were mailed to sampled teachers at their schools. Public schools and teachers within those schools were sampled. The weighted response rate for schools providing lists of teachers for sampling was 81 percent and the weighted response rate for sampled teachers completing questionnaires was 79 percent. Key statistics produced from FRSS 95 were information on the use of computers and internet access in the classroom; availability and use of computing devices software and school or district networks (including remote access) by teachers; students� use of educational technology; teachers� preparation to use educational technology for instruction; and technology-related professional development activities.,Zipped DAT,,"[computers, information-technology, internet]",Creative Commons CCZero,,,11,11,,,"Teachers' Use of Educational Technology in U.S. Public Schools, 2009",2010-05-06,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/teachers-use-of-educational-technology-in-u-s-public-schools-2009

1596,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce",,,The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites collect visible and infrared cloud imagery as well as monitoring the atmospheric oceanographic hydrologic cryospheric and near-Earth space environments. The DMSP program maintains a constellation of sun-synchronous near-polar orbiting satellites. The orbital period is 101 minutes and inclination is 99 degrees. The atmospheric and oceanographic sensors record radiances at visible infrared and microwave wavelengths. The solar geophysical sensors measure ionospheric plasma fluxes densities temperatures and velocities. DMSP visible and infrared imagery of clouds covers a 3000 km swath thus each satellite provides global coverage of both day night time conditions each day. The field view of the microwave imagers and sounders is only 1500 km thus approximately 3 days data are required for one instrument to provide global coverage at equatorial latitudes. The solar geophysical instruments make in-situ measurements of ionospheric parameters some of which vary very rapidly. The NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (formerly National Geophysical Data Center) receive the complete DMSP data stream from the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) Offutt Air Force Base Omaha Nebraska. Data are currently transmitted in near realtime from AFWA directly to the archive via a designated T1 line. Archive processing prepares orbital data sets of calibrated quality assessed data organized as a time-series restores data lost during transmissionand accurately computes satellite positions. NCEI maintains an archive of all data recorded on DMSP satellites as relayed to The NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (formerly National Geophysical Data Center) by the Air Force Weather Agency.

1597,,State of Connecticut,,,This dataset contains data by district on student SAT scores relative to the SAT College and Career Readiness (CCR) Benchmark score of 1550 (critical reading mathematics and writing sections combined) for the graduating classes of 2012 and 2013.  According to research conducted by the College Board* a score of 1550 indicates that a student will have a 65 percent or greater likelihood of achieving a B- average or higher during the first year of college.  This dataset also provides an estimated SAT Participation Rate which equals the number of SAT test-taking seniors in the district divided by the number of seniors enrolled in the district as a percentage.  These participation rates are considered an estimate because the grade level of the SAT test-taker is self-reported by the student at the time of registration for the SAT while the total number of seniors enrolled in the district is reported to the Connecticut State Department of Education (CSDE) by the district. These are the best available estimates of SAT participation rates.  The Benchmark Performance reflect the results of only those who participate in the SAT.  Because participation rates vary from district to district the CSDE provides both the estimated Participation rates together with the Benchmark Performance in order to promote fair and valid comparisons across districts.   Note The data are suppressed when there are too few test-takers to sufficiently protect privacy.  *The research report can be found at    http//research.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/publications/2012/7/researchreport-2011-5-sat-college-readiness-benchmark-secondary-performance.pdf,CSV,,"[district, education, sat]",No license information was provided.,,,11,11,,,SAT District Participation and Performance: 2012-2013,2014-10-30,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/sat-district-participation-and-performance-2012-2013

1599,,State of Illinois,,,Introduction This report presents projections of population from 2015 to 2025 by age and sex for Illinois Chicago and Illinois counties produced for the Certificate of Need (CON) Program. As actual future population trends are unknown the projected numbers should not be considered a precise prediction of the future population; rather these projections calculated under a specific set of assumptions indicate the levels of population that would result if our assumptions about each population component (births deaths and net migration) hold true. The assumptions used in this report and the details presented below generally assume a continuation of current trends. Methodology These projections were produced using a demographic cohort-component projection model. In this model each component of population change – birth death and net migration – is projected separately for each five-year birth cohort and sex. The cohort – component method employs the following basic demographic balancing equation P1 = P0 + B – D + NM Where P1 = Population at the end of the period; P0 = Population at the beginning of the period; B = Resident births during the period; D = Resident deaths during the period; and NM = Net migration (Inmigration – Outmigration) during the period. The model roughly works as follows for every five-year projection period the base population disaggregated by five-year age groups and sex is “survived” to the next five-year period by applying the appropriate survival rates for each age and sex group; next net migrants by age and sex are added to the survived population. The population under 5 years of age is generated by applying age specific birth rates to the survived females in childbearing age (15 to 49 years). Base Population These projections began with the July 1 2010 population estimates by age and sex produced by the U.S. Census Bureau. The most recent census population of April 1 2010 was the base for July 1 2010 population estimates. Special Populations In 19 counties the college dormitory population or adult inmates in correctional facilities accounted for 5 percent or more of the total population of the county; these counties were considered as special counties. There were six college dorm counties (Champaign Coles DeKalb Jackson McDonough and McLean) and 13 correctional facilities counties (Bond Brown Crawford Fayette Fulton Jefferson Johnson Lawrence Lee Logan Montgomery Perry and Randolph) that qualified as special counties. When projecting the population these special populations were first subtracted from the base populations for each special county; then they were added back to the projected population to produce the total population projections by age and sex. The base special population by age and sex from the 2010 population census was used for this purpose with the assumption that this population will remain the same throughout each projection period. Mortality Future deaths were projected by applying age and sex specific survival rates to each age and sex specific base population. The assumptions on survival rates were developed on the basis of trends of mortality rates in the individual life tables constructed for each level of geography for 1989-1991 1999-2001 and 2009-2011. The application of five-year survival rates provides a projection of the number of persons from the initial population expected to be alive in five years. Resident deaths data by age and sex from 1989 to 2011 were provided by the Illinois Center for Health Statistics (ICHS) Illinois Department of Public Health. Fertility Total fertility rates (TFRs) were first computed for each county. For most counties the projected 2015 TFRs were computed as the average of the 2000 and 2010 TFRs. 2010 or 2015 rates were retained for 2020 projections depending on the birth trend of each county. The age-specific birth rates (ASBR) were next computed for each county by multiplying the 2010 ASBR by each projected TFR. Total births were then projected for each county by applying age-specific birth rates to the projected female population of reproductive ages (15 to 49 years). The total births were broken down by sex using an assumed sex-ratio at birth. These births were survived five years applying assumed survival ratios to get the projected population for the age group 0-4. For the special counties special populations by age and sex were taken out before computing age-specific birth rates. The resident birth data used to compute age-specific birth rates for 1989-1991 1999-2001 and 2009-2011 came from ICHS. Births to females younger than 15 years of age were added to those of the 15-19 age group and births to women older than 49 years of age were added to the 45-49 age group. Net Migration Migration is the major component of population change in Illinois Chicago and Illinois counties. The state is experiencing a significant loss of population through internal (domestic migration within the U.S.) net migration. Unlike data on births and deaths migration data based on administrative records are not available on a regular basis. Most data on migration are collected through surveys or indirectly from administrative records (IRS individual tax returns). For this report net migration trends have been reviewed using data from different sources and methods (such as residual method) from the University of Wisconsin Madison Illinois Department of Public Health individual exemptions data from the Internal Revenue Service and survey data from the U.S. Census Bureau. On the basis of knowledge gained through this review and of levels of net migration from different sources assumptions have been made that Illinois will have annual net migrants of -40 000 -35000 and -30000 during 2010-2015 2015-2020 and 2020-2025 respectively. These figures have been distributed among the counties using age and sex distribution of net migrants during 1995-2000. The 2000 population census was the last decennial census which included the question “Where did you live five years ago?” The age and sex distribution of the net migrants was derived using answers to this question. The net migration for Chicago has been derived independently using census survival method for 1990-2000 and 2000-2010 under the assumption that the annual net migration for Chicago will be -40000 -30000 and -25000 for 2010-2015 2015-2020 and 2020-2025 respectively. The age and sex distribution from the 2000-2010 net migration was used to distribute the net migrants for the projection periods. Conclusion These projections were prepared for use by the Certificate of Need (CON) Program; they are produced using evidence-based techniques reasonable assumptions and the best available input data. However as assumptions of future demographic trends may contain errors the resulting projections are unlikely to be free of errors. In general projections of small areas are less reliable than those for larger areas and the farther in the future projections are made the less reliable they may become. When possible these projections should be regularly reviewed and updated using more recent birth death and migration data.,CSV,,"[age, estimates, idph, population, projections, sex]",No license information was provided.,,,11,11,,,IDPH Population Projections For Illinois Counties 2010 To 2025,2015-06-29,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/idph-population-projections-for-illinois-counties-2010-to-2025

The geodatabases                        include feature class layers of information for the fifty states the District of Columbia Puerto Rico and the Island areas (American Samoa the                         Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Guam and the United States Virgin Islands). The geodatabases do not contain any sensitive data. The                         2015 TIGER Geodatabases are designed for use with Esriâs ArcGIS.                   The 2015 State Geodatabase for Illinois contains multiple layers. These layers are the Block Block Group Census Designated Place Census Tract                 County Subdivision and Incorporated Place layers.                  Block Groups (BGs) are clusters of blocks within the same census tract. Each census tract contains at least one BG and BGs are uniquely numbered                 within census tracts.  BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same                 decennial census.  For example tabulation blocks numbered 3001 3002 3003.. 3999 within census tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that                 census tract.  BGs coded 0 are intended to only include water area no land area and they are generally in territorial seas coastal water and                 Great Lakes water areas. Block groups generally contain  between 600 and 3000 people.  A BG usually covers a contiguous area but never crosses                 county or census tract boundaries. They may however cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions places urban                 areas voting districts congressional districts and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas.                   The BG boundaries in this release are those that were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for the                 2010 Census.                    The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to                 previous decennial censuses.  Census tracts generally have a population size between 1200 and 8000 people with an optimum size of 4000 people.                 When first delineated census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics economic status and living                 conditions.  The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.  Physical changes in street patterns caused by                 highway construction new development and so forth may require boundary revisions.  In addition census tracts occasionally are split due to                 population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline.  Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable                 features.  They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to                 allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.  State and                 county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy.  In a few rare instances a census tract may                 consist of noncontiguous areas.  These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities                 that are themselves noncontiguous.  For the 2010 Census the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that                 include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American                 Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little                 or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park military installation or a business/industrial                 park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area no land area.                    An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD)                 which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard necessarily to population.  Places always nest within a state                 but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries.  An incorporated place usually is a city town village or borough but can have                 other legal descriptions.  CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places.  CDPs are delineated                 to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state                 in which they are located.  The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with state local and/or tribal officials and usually coincide                 with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity.  CDP boundaries often change from one decennial                 census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily                 have the same boundary.  The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs is that they must contain some housing and population.                    The boundaries of most incorporated places in this shapefile are as of January 1 2013 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and                 Annexation Survey (BAS).  Limited updates that occurred after January 1 2013 such as newly incorporated places are also included.  The boundaries                 of all CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) for the 2010 Census.                  The primary legal divisions of most states are termed counties.  In Louisiana these divisions are known as parishes.  In Alaska which has no                 counties the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs city and boroughs municipalities and for the unorganized area census areas.  The                 latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau.  In four states (Maryland Missouri                 Nevada and Virginia) there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary                 divisions of their states.  These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data                 presentation.  The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data                 presentation.  The Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation Municipios in Puerto                 Rico Districts and Islands in American Samoa Municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and Islands in the U.S. Virgin                 Islands.  The entire area of the United States Puerto Rico and the Island Areas is covered by counties or equivalent entities.                    The boundaries for counties and equivalent entities are mostly as of January 1 2013 primarily as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and                 Annexation Survey (BAS).  However some changes made after January 2013 including the addition and deletion of counties are included.                  County subdivisions are the primary divisions of counties and their equivalent entities for the reporting of Census Bureau data. They include                 legally-recognized minor civil divisions (MCDs) and statistical census county divisions (CCDs) and unorganized territories.  For the 2010 Census                 the MCDs are the primary governmental and/or administrative divisions of counties in 29 States and Puerto Rico; Tennessee changed from having CCDs                 for Census 2000 to having MCDs for the 2010 Census.  In MCD States where no MCD exists or is not defined the Census Bureau creates statistical                 unorganized territories to complete coverage.  The entire area of the United States Puerto Rico and the Island Areas are covered by county                 subdivisions.  The boundaries of most legal MCDs are as of January 1 2013 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey                 (BAS).

1627,,Department of Veterans Affairs,,,"The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides healthcare services to its veterans across the USA including territories and possessions. Healthcare services are delivered through 18 geographically divided administrative areas called Veterans Integrated Services Networks (VISN). Each VISN is divided into healthcare areas called Markets and Submarkets. Each Submarket is divided into Sectors and each Sector comprises one or more counties. In 1995 a process was created to coordinate and review the realignment of the Heath Care Networks. The Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services (CARES) process established VISN 'subsets' called Markets Submarkets and Sectors which being smaller than VISNs allowed for more precise analyses for greater access measurement to health care.    The County layer is the base geographic unit of the VISN-Market-Submarket-Sector-County hierarchy. The key attribute in this data set is the FIPS which is defined as a string of 5 characters with unique alphanumeric combinations for each site. The first 2 are the State FIPS code and the next 3 designate the County FIPS code. Example '01031' is the FIPS for Coffee County Alabama.    A Sector is a cluster of geographically adjacent counties within a VA Submarket. The process of aggregating counties into sectors uses a combination of automated algorithms and manual inspection of maps. The key attribute in this data set is the SECTOR which is defined as a string of eight characters broken down into four parts in the order of VISN (2-char) Market (1-char) Submarket (1-char) and Sector(1-char) connected by a hyphen. For example Sector 12-a-3-A indicates VISN 12 Market a Submarket 3 and Sector A.    Sub-markets reflect a clustering of the enrollee population within a market and are an aggregation of Sectors. The key attribute in this data set is the SUBMARKET which is defined as a string of six characters broken down in three parts in the order of VISN (2-char) Market (1-char) and Submarket (1-char) connected by a hyphen. For example Submarket 12-a-3 indicates VISN 12 Market a and Submarket 3.    CARES defines Markets as ""an aggregated geographic area having a sufficient population and geographic size to both benefit from the coordination and planning of health care services and to support a full healthcare delivery system (i.e. primary care mental health care inpatient care tertiary care and long term care)"". Each Market is built from Submarkets. The key attribute in this data set is the MARKET which is defined as a string of four characters broken down in two parts in the order of HCN (2-char) and Market (1-char) connected by a hyphen. For example Market 12-a indicates VISN 12 and Market a.    The key attribute in the VISN data set is defined as a string of two characters from 01-23 excluding 3 11 13 14 and 18; a VISN also has an officially recognized VA title. For example VISN 06 is the Mid-Atlantic Health Care Network. VISNs can span across neighboring countries to include areas that are not contiguous. For example VISN 08 includes Florida and Puerto Rico in addition to most of Florida and southern Georgia and VISN 20 includes Alaska and parts of the northwest conterminous United States. Each VISN is built from Markets Submarkets Sectors and Counties derived from Census (2010) County data.    Because VISNs are composed of VHA markets VISN boundaries align with the outer edges of their constituent markets’ boundaries. Markets cross state borders wherever it is necessary to keep outpatient clinics (e.g. Community-Based Outpatient Clinics(CBOCs)) and their catchment areas in the same market as their parent medical centers. Thus VISN boundaries also cross state borders. In 2016 senior leadership considered the challenge of conforming VISN boundaries to MyVA Districts which coincide with state boundaries. It was agreed that VHA would not separate outpatient clinics from their parent medical centers due to added complexity. Many outpatient providers hold clinics at their mother facilities and clinics are on the same health record as their parent facilities. VISN and market maps created by VHA Policy and Planning conform to these principals and are the official maps for VHA VISNs and markets.    While the Planning Systems Support Group (PSSG) develops the feature classes depicting the various VHA geographies the PSSG does not have the authority to modify or reorganize the boundaries. The boundaries are developed at higher levels of the VHA and passed to the PSSG to be translated into spatial features.",ZIP,,"[boundaries, markets, sectors, submarkets, veteran, vha, visn]",Creative Commons CCZero,,,10,10,,,"Veterans Integrated Services Networks (VISN), Markets, Submarkets, Sectors and Counties by Geographic Location",2017-12-07,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/veterans-integrated-services-networks-visn-markets-submarkets-sectors-and-counties-by-geog

1631,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce",,,The NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) was initially completed for the 31-year period from 1979 to 2009 in January 2010. The CFSR was designed and executed as a global high resolution coupled atmosphere-ocean-land surface-sea ice system to provide the best estimate of the state of these coupled domains over this 31-year period. The CFSR has also been extended as an operational real time product into the future. New features of the CFSR include (1) coupling of atmosphere and ocean during the generation of the 6 hour guess field; (2) an interactive sea-ice model; and (3) assimilation of satellite radiances by the Grid-point Statistical Interpolation (GSI) scheme over the entire period. The CFSR global atmosphere resolution is approximately 38 km (T382) with 64 levels extending from the surface to 0.26 hPa. The global ocean's latitudinal spacing is 0.25 deg at the equator extending to a global 0.5 deg beyond the tropics with 40 levels to a depth of 4737m. The global land surface model has four4 soil levels and the global sea ice model has 3 layers. The CFSR atmospheric model has observed variations in carbon dioxide (CO2) over the 1979-2009 period together with changes in aerosols and other trace gases and solar variations. Most available in-situ and satellite observation data were included in the CFSR. Satellite-based radiance observations were bias corrected with spin-up runs at full resolution taking into account variable CO2 concentrations. This procedure enabled smooth transitions of the observation record due to evolutionary changes in satellite observing systems. The CFSR atmospheric oceanic and land surface output products are available at an hourly time resolution and at a 0.5 deg x 0.5 deg latitude and longitude resolution. In total there are 10 data products available from the National Climatic Data Center that make up the CFS Reanalysis collection MON - Monthly Means; TIME - Parameter Timeseries; PGB - 3-D Pressure Level Data; FLX - Surface and Radiative Fluxes; OCN - 3-D Ocean Data; IPV - 3-D Isentropic Level Data; DIAB - 3-D Diabatic Heating Data; GRBLOW - Low-Resolution Data; HIC - High-Res Initial Conditions; LIC - Low-Res Initial Conditions.

Patients with a ratio of less than 0.5 (meaning fewer controller and more rescue medication claims) were 1.5-2.0 times more likely to have a subsequent emergent healthcare visit than children with higher ratios. Providers and payers may consider tracking the asthma medication ratio and using it to signal pediatric patients at high risk for emergent health care visits. This will allow targeted interventions to improve controller medication use in these highest risk patients. Ultimately increasing controller medication use in these patients would lead to improved ratios and fewer emergent healthcare visits.,,,"[chronic-condition, emergency-room-depa..., hospital, medicaid, outcomes, prescription-drugs, publications, state]",No license information was provided.

1636,,City of Tempe,,,Tempe’s roadways are an important means of transportation for residents the workforce students and visitors. Tempe measures the quality and condition of its roadways using a Pavement Quality Index (PQI). This measure rated from a low of 0 to a high of 100 is used by the City to plan for maintenance and repairs and to allocate resources in the most efficient way possible.  This measure is created using pavement quality data maintained in the RoadMatrix Pavement Management Program. About every three years the City surveys pavement such as the smoothness of roadways and any signs of distress in the pavement surface. This data is then used to calculate the PQI which determines roadway maintenance prioritization schedules as well as the most optimal road treatment options (such as placing a filler material in the cracks and treating the entire pavement surface milling and replacing the top layer of the asphalt pavement reconstructing the street section)  This page provides data for the performance measure related to PQI.

1638,,City of Tempe,,,The Tempe Fire Medical Rescue Department (TFMR) is an “all hazards” department that responds to all types of calls for service. Advanced Life Support (ALS) is an advanced set of life supporting procedures that go further than Basic Life Support (BLS) to assist the ill or injured with breathing blood circulation and other vital functions in emergencies. The response time for providing Advanced Life Support for a life-threatening event is related to patient outcomes (chance of full recovery).  This data is based on calls received by the Phoenix 911 system and given an Advanced Life Support (ALS) response code indicating the nature of the call.          Alarm Processing Time (also known as Dispatch Time to Notification Time) is calculated from the time Phoenix 911 answers the call to the time Phoenix 911 notifies a Fire Department Unit.          Turnout Time (also known as Acknowledgment Time to Roll Time) is calculated from the time a Fire Department Unit is notified of the call to the time the unit rolls out of the station or begins proceeding to the incident.

In 2008 there was a fall Hypoxia Watch Cruise in October and November. The NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service Mississippi Laboratories at Pascagoula and Stennis Space Center and the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) at Stennis Space Center began the Hypoxia Watch project in 2001. Scientists aboard the NOAA Research Vessel Oregon II measure seawater properties such as water temperature salinity chlorophyll and dissolved oxygen at each of approximately 240 locations as the Oregon II makes its way from Brownsville Texas to the mouth of the Mississippi River then into Florida waters. A scientist aboard the ship processes the measurements from electronic dissolved oxygen sensors checks the measurements periodically with chemical analyses of the seawater then sends the data by e-mail to NCEI at Stennis Space Center approximately every three to five days. Personnel at NCEI transform the dissolved oxygen measurements into contour maps which identify areas of low oxygen or hypoxia. During the 6-week cruise as the data is received from the ship NCEI generates new maps and immediately publishes them on the web. The first map will usually cover an area near Brownsville TX then gradually areas along the Texas Louisiana and Florida coasts will be added.

In particular this feature dataset includes the polygon features representing the spatial extent and boundaries of the BLM National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS) Wilderness Areas and Wilderness Study Areas. A Wilderness is a special place where the earth and its community of life are essentially undisturbed; they retain a primeval character without permanent improvements and generally appear to have been affected primarily by the forces of nature. In 1964 Congress established the National Wilderness Preservation System and designated the first Wilderness Areas in passing the Wilderness Act. The uniquely American idea of wilderness has become an increasingly significant tool to ensure long-term protection of natural landscapes. Wilderness protects the habitat of numerous wildlife species and serves as a biodiversity bank for many species of plants and animals. Wilderness is also a source of clean water. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 directed the Bureau to inventory and study its roadless areas for wilderness characteristics. To be designated as a Wilderness Study Area an area has to have the following characteristics Size - roadless areas of at least 5000 acres of public lands or of a manageable size; Naturalness - generally appears to have been affected primarily by the forces of nature; Opportunities - provides outstanding opportunities for solitude or primitive and unconfined types of recreation. In addition Wilderness Study Areas often have special qualities such as ecological geological educational historical scientific and scenic values. BLM National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS) Other Related Lands are lands not in Wilderness or Wilderness Study Areas that have been determined to have wilderness character through inventory or land use planning. These lands fall into one of two categories. The first category are lands with ""wildernes value and characteristics"". These are inventoried areas not in Wilderness or Wilderness Study Areas that have been determined to meet the size naturalness and the outstanding solitude and/or the outstanding primitive and unconfined recreation criteria. The second category are ""wilderness characteristic protection areas"". These are former lands with ""wildernes value and characteristics"" where a plan decision has been made to protect them.

1655,,U.S. Department of Health & Human Services,,,There has been a growing interest in understanding the utilization patterns of patients with chronic conditions. Even though there is a lack of standard definition and identification of a chronic condition these conditions such as heart disease cancer obesity and diabetes are long-lasting and persistent health problems that require continuous care. Recent research has emphasized the disproportionate share of beneficiaries with chronic conditions in healthcare expenditures (Anderson 2010). For example patients with multiple chronic conditions can cost up to seven times as much as patients with only one chronic condition. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) chronic diseases are responsible for more than 75 percent of the 2.5 trillion spent annually on health care. Examples of efforts to estimate the spending or costs by individual conditions are shown in Exhibit 1.,,,"[chronic-condition, dual-eligibles, eligibility, hospital, medicare, national, part-a, part-b, payments, preventive-services, publications, rates, readmissions, screenings]",No license information was provided.

1660,,Department of Energy,,,The Newberry Volcano EGS Demonstration in central Oregon a 5 year project begun in 2010 tests recent technological advances designed to reduce the cost of power generated by EGS in a hot dry well (NWG 55-29) drilled in 2008. First the stimulation pumps used were designed to run for weeks and deliver large volumes of water at moderate well-head pressure. Second to stimulate multiple zones AltaRock developed thermo-degradable zonal isolation materials (TZIMs) to seal off fractures in a geothermal well to stimulate secondary and tertiary fracture zones. The TZIMs degrade within weeks resulting in an optimized injection/ production profile of the entire well. Third the project followed a project-specific Induced Seismicity Mitigation Plan (ISMP) to evaluate monitor for and mitigate felt induced seismicity. An initial stimulation was conducted in 2012 and continued for 7 weeks with over 41000 m3 of water injected. Further analysis indicated a shallow casing leak and an unstable formation in the open hole. The well was repaired with a shallow casing tieback and perforated liner in the open hole and re-stimulated in 2014. The second stimulation started September 23rd 2014 and continued for 3 weeks with over 9500 m3 of water injected. The well was treated with several batches of newly tested TZIM diverter materials and a newly designed Diverter Injection Vessel Assembly (DIVA) which was the main modification to the original injection system design used in 2012. A second round of stimulation that included two perforation shots and additional batches of TZIM was conducted on November 11th 2014 for 9 days with an additional 4000 m3 of water injected. The stimulations resulted in a 3-4 fold increase in injectivity and PTS data indicates partial blocking and creation of flow zones near the bottom of the well.

1676,,U.S. Department of Health & Human Services,,,This dataset describes drug poisoning deaths at the county level by selected demographic characteristics and includes age-adjusted death rates for drug poisoning from 1999 to 2015.    Deaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision (ICDâ10). Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICDâ10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40âX44 (unintentional) X60âX64 (suicide) X85 (homicide) or Y10âY14 (undetermined intent).    Estimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011â2015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.    Estimate does not meet standards of reliability or precision. Death rates are flagged as âUnreliableâ in the chart when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less.    Death rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICDâ10 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99 âOther ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortalityâ (2). For example this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Estimates should be interpreted with caution.    Smoothed county age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100000 population) were obtained according to methods described elsewhere (3â5). Briefly two-stage hierarchical models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning for each year during 1999â2015. These annual county-level estimates âborrow strengthâ across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (35). Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County Colo. and Denali County Alaska before 2003 (67). Additionally Bedford City Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015.

1720,,U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,,,Ongoing honey bee colony losses are of significant international concern because of the essential role these insects play in pollinating many high nutrient crops such as fruits vegetables and nuts.  Both chemical and non-chemical stressors have been implicated as possible contributors to colony failure; however the potential role(s) of commonly-used neonicotinoid insecticides has emerged as particularly concerning. Neonicotinoids act on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the central nervous system to eliminate target pest insects. However mounting evidence indicates that these neonicotinoids also may adversely affect beneficial pollinators such as the honey bee (Apis mellifera) via impairments on learning and memory and ultimately foraging success. The specific mechanisms linking activation of the nAChR to adverse effects on learning and memory are uncertain. Additionally clear connections between observed impacts on individual bees and colony level effects are lacking. The objective of this review was to develop adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) as a means to evaluate the biological plausibility and empirical evidence supporting (or refuting) the linkage between activation of the physiological target site the nAChR and colony level consequences. Development of AOPs has led to the identification of research gaps which for example may be of high priority in understanding how perturbation of pathways involved in neurotransmission can adversely affect normal colony functions causing colony instability and subsequent bee population failure. A putative AOP network was developed laying the foundation for further insights as to the role of combined chemical and non-chemical stressors in impacting bee populations. Insights gained from the putative AOP network assembly which more realistically represents multi-stressor impacts on honey bee colonies are promising toward understanding common sensitive nodes in key biological pathways and identifying where mitigation strategies may be focused to reduce colony losses.

1722,,State of Illinois,,,Introduction This report presents projections of population from 2015 to 2025 by age and sex for Illinois Chicago and Illinois counties produced for the Certificate of Need (CON) Program. As actual future population trends are unknown the projected numbers should not be considered a precise prediction of the future population; rather these projections calculated under a specific set of assumptions indicate the levels of population that would result if our assumptions about each population component (births deaths and net migration) hold true. The assumptions used in this report and the details presented below generally assume a continuation of current trends. Methodology These projections were produced using a demographic cohort-component projection model. In this model each component of population change – birth death and net migration – is projected separately for each five-year birth cohort and sex. The cohort – component method employs the following basic demographic balancing equation P1 = P0 + B – D + NM Where P1 = Population at the end of the period; P0 = Population at the beginning of the period; B = Resident births during the period; D = Resident deaths during the period; and NM = Net migration (Inmigration – Outmigration) during the period. The model roughly works as follows for every five-year projection period the base population disaggregated by five-year age groups and sex is “survived” to the next five-year period by applying the appropriate survival rates for each age and sex group; next net migrants by age and sex are added to the survived population. The population under 5 years of age is generated by applying age specific birth rates to the survived females in childbearing age (15 to 49 years). Base Population These projections began with the July 1 2010 population estimates by age and sex produced by the U.S. Census Bureau. The most recent census population of April 1 2010 was the base for July 1 2010 population estimates. Special Populations In 19 counties the college dormitory population or adult inmates in correctional facilities accounted for 5 percent or more of the total population of the county; these counties were considered as special counties. There were six college dorm counties (Champaign Coles DeKalb Jackson McDonough and McLean) and 13 correctional facilities counties (Bond Brown Crawford Fayette Fulton Jefferson Johnson Lawrence Lee Logan Montgomery Perry and Randolph) that qualified as special counties. When projecting the population these special populations were first subtracted from the base populations for each special county; then they were added back to the projected population to produce the total population projections by age and sex. The base special population by age and sex from the 2010 population census was used for this purpose with the assumption that this population will remain the same throughout each projection period. Mortality Future deaths were projected by applying age and sex specific survival rates to each age and sex specific base population. The assumptions on survival rates were developed on the basis of trends of mortality rates in the individual life tables constructed for each level of geography for 1989-1991 1999-2001 and 2009-2011. The application of five-year survival rates provides a projection of the number of persons from the initial population expected to be alive in five years. Resident deaths data by age and sex from 1989 to 2011 were provided by the Illinois Center for Health Statistics (ICHS) Illinois Department of Public Health. Fertility Total fertility rates (TFRs) were first computed for each county. For most counties the projected 2015 TFRs were computed as the average of the 2000 and 2010 TFRs. 2010 or 2015 rates were retained for 2020 projections depending on the birth trend of each county. The age-specific birth rates (ASBR) were next computed for each county by multiplying the 2010 ASBR by each projected TFR. Total births were then projected for each county by applying age-specific birth rates to the projected female population of reproductive ages (15 to 49 years). The total births were broken down by sex using an assumed sex-ratio at birth. These births were survived five years applying assumed survival ratios to get the projected population for the age group 0-4. For the special counties special populations by age and sex were taken out before computing age-specific birth rates. The resident birth data used to compute age-specific birth rates for 1989-1991 1999-2001 and 2009-2011 came from ICHS. Births to females younger than 15 years of age were added to those of the 15-19 age group and births to women older than 49 years of age were added to the 45-49 age group. Net Migration Migration is the major component of population change in Illinois Chicago and Illinois counties. The state is experiencing a significant loss of population through internal (domestic migration within the U.S.) net migration. Unlike data on births and deaths migration data based on administrative records are not available on a regular basis. Most data on migration are collected through surveys or indirectly from administrative records (IRS individual tax returns). For this report net migration trends have been reviewed using data from different sources and methods (such as residual method) from the University of Wisconsin Madison Illinois Department of Public Health individual exemptions data from the Internal Revenue Service and survey data from the U.S. Census Bureau. On the basis of knowledge gained through this review and of levels of net migration from different sources assumptions have been made that Illinois will have annual net migrants of -40 000 -35000 and -30000 during 2010-2015 2015-2020 and 2020-2025 respectively. These figures have been distributed among the counties using age and sex distribution of net migrants during 1995-2000. The 2000 population census was the last decennial census which included the question “Where did you live five years ago?” The age and sex distribution of the net migrants was derived using answers to this question. The net migration for Chicago has been derived independently using census survival method for 1990-2000 and 2000-2010 under the assumption that the annual net migration for Chicago will be -40000 -30000 and -25000 for 2010-2015 2015-2020 and 2020-2025 respectively. The age and sex distribution from the 2000-2010 net migration was used to distribute the net migrants for the projection periods. Conclusion These projections were prepared for use by the Certificate of Need (CON) Program; they are produced using evidence-based techniques reasonable assumptions and the best available input data. However as assumptions of future demographic trends may contain errors the resulting projections are unlikely to be free of errors. In general projections of small areas are less reliable than those for larger areas and the farther in the future projections are made the less reliable they may become. When possible these projections should be regularly reviewed and updated using more recent birth death and migration data.,CSV,,"[age, estimates, idph, population, projections, sex]",No license information was provided.,,,10,10,,,IDPH Population Projections For Chicago By Age And Sex 2010 To 2025,2015-06-29,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/idph-population-projections-for-chicago-by-age-and-sex-2010-to-2025

1733,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce",,,This dataset replaces the previous Time Bias Corrected Divisional Temperature-Precipitation Drought Index. The new divisional data set (nCLIMDIV) is based on the Global Historical Climatological Network-Daily (GHCN-D) and makes use of several improvements to the previous data set. For the input data improvements include additional station networks quality assurance reviews and temperature bias adjustments. Perhaps the most extensive improvement is to the computational approach which now employs climatologically aided interpolation. This 5km grid based calculation nCLIMGRID helps to address topographic and network variability. This data set is primarily used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) to issue State of the Climate Reports on a monthly basis. These reports summarize recent temperature and precipitation conditions and long-term trends at a variety of spatial scales the smallest being the climate division level. Data at the climate division level are aggregated to compute statewide regional and national snapshots of climate conditions. For CONUS the period of record is from 1895-present. Derived quantities such as Standardized precipitation Index (SPI) Palmer Drought Indices (PDSI PHDI PMDI and ZNDX) and degree days are also available for the CONUS sites.   In March 2015 data for thirteen Alaskan climate divisions were added to the nCLIMDIV data set. Data for the new Alaskan climate divisions begin in 1925 through the present and are included in all nCLIMDIV monthly updates. Alaskan climate data include the following elements for divisional and statewide coverage average temperature maximum temperature (highs) minimum temperature (lows) and precipitation. The Alaska nCLIMDIV data were created and updated using similar methodology as that for the CONUS but with a different approach to establishing the underlying climatology.

The survey is conducted each month by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics and provides comprehensive data on the labor force the employed and the unemployed classified by such characteristics as age sex race family relationship marital status occupation and industry attachment. The information is collected by trained interviewers from a sample of about 60000 households located in 754 sample areas. These areas are chosen to represent all counties and independent cities in the United States with coverage in 50 States and the District of Columbia. The data collected are based on the activity or status reported for the calendar week including the 12th of the month. Earnings data are available for all workers with data    available by age race Hispanic or Latino ethnicity sex occupation usual full- or part-time status educational attainment and other characteristics.,CSV,,"[demographic, earnings, employment, family, hours-of-work, marital, unemployment, union]",Creative Commons CCZero,,,10,10,,,Current Population Survey - Weekly and Hourly Earnings,2014-02-14,https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/current-population-survey-weekly-and-hourly-earnings
1744,,U.S. Department of Health & Human Services,,,This is the complete dataset for the 500 Cities project 2017 release. This dataset includes 2015 2014 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5) health outcomes (13) and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Division of Population Health Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2015 2014) Census Bureau 2010 census population data and American Community Survey (ACS) 2011-2015 2010-2014 estimates. Because some questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS there are 7 measures from the 2014 BRFSS that are the same in the 2017 release as the previous 2016 release.

1751,,U.S. Department of Health & Human Services,,,"The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) series (formerly titled National Household Survey on Drug Abuse) primarily measures the prevalence and correlates of drug use in the United States. The surveys are designed to provide quarterly as well as annual estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs alcohol and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime annual and past-month usage for the following drug classes marijuana cocaine (and crack) hallucinogens heroin inhalants alcohol tobacco and nonmedical use of prescription drugs including pain relievers tranquilizers stimulants and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts health care access and coverage illegal activities and arrest record problems resulting from the use of drugs and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2013 survey including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These ""youth experiences"" items covered a variety of topics such as neighborhood environment illegal activities drug use by friends social support extracurricular activities exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and access to care perceived risk of using drugs perceived availability of drugs driving and personal behavior and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008 a split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems. Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH however all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions.
