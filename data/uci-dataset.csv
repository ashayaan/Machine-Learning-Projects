For this reason there are inter-subject variations in the speeds and amplitudes of some activities. The activities are performed at the Bilkent University Sports Hall in the Electrical and Electronics Engineering Building and in a flat outdoor area on campus. Sensor units are calibrated to acquire data at 25 Hz sampling frequency. The 5-min signals are divided into 5-sec segments so that 480(=60x8) signal segments are obtained for each activity. The 19 activities are: sitting (A1) standing (A2) lying on back and on right side (A3 and A4) ascending and descending stairs (A5 and A6) standing in an elevator still (A7) and moving around in an elevator (A8) walking in a parking lot (A9) walking on a treadmill with a speed of 4 km/h (in flat and 15 deg inclined positions) (A10 and A11)running on a treadmill with a speed of 8 km/h (A12) exercising on a stepper (A13) exercising on a cross trainer (A14) cycling on an exercise bike in horizontal and vertical positions (A15 and A16)rowing (A17) jumping (A18) and playing basketball (A19). File structure: 19 activities (a) (in the order given above) 8 subjects   (p)60 segments   (s) 5 units on torso (T) right arm (RA) left arm (LA) right leg (RL) left leg (LL) 9 sensors on each unit (xyz accelerometers xyz gyroscopes xyz magnetometers) Folders a01 a02 ... a19 contain data recorded from the 19 activities. For each activity the subfolders p1 p2 ... p8 contain data from each of the 8 subjects. In each subfolder there are 60 text files s01 s02 ... s60 one for each segment. In each text file there are 5 units x 9 sensors = 45 columns and 5 sec x 25 Hz = 125 rows.Each column contains the 125 samples of data acquired from one of the sensors of one of the units over a period of 5 sec.Each row contains data acquired from all of the 45 sensor axes at a particular sampling instant separated by commas. Columns 1-45 correspond to:   T_xacc  T_yacc  T_zacc  T_xgyro ...  T_ymag  T_zmagRA_xacc RA_yacc RA_zacc RA_xgyro ... RA_ymag RA_zmagLA_xacc LA_yacc LA_zacc LA_xgyro ...

Low Resolution Spectrometer,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Low+Resolution+Spectrometer,1988-03-01,Physical,33933,Originator:  Infra-Red Astronomy Satellite Project Database Donor:  John Stutz <STUTZ '@' pluto.arc.nasa.gov> It's possible that one of John's colleagues actually provided this to UCI perhaps Mike Marshall (MARSHALL%PLU '@' io.arc.nasa.gov),The Infra-Red Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) was the first attempt to map the full sky at infra-red wavelengths.  This could not be done from ground observatories because large portions of the infra-red spectrum is absorbed by the atmosphere.  The primary observing program was the full high resolution sky mapping performed by scanning at 4 frequencies. The Low Resolution Observation (IRAS-LRS) program observed high intensity sources over two continuous spectral bands.  This database derives from a subset of the higher quality LRS observations taken between 12h and 24h right ascension.  This database contains 531 high quality spectra derived from the IRAS-LRS database.  The original data contained 100 spectral measurements in each of two overlapping bands.  Of these 44 blue band and 49 red band channels contain usable flux measurements.  Only these are included here.  The original spectral intensities values are compressed to 4-digits and each spectrum includes 5 rescaling parameters.  We have used the LRS specified algorithm to rescale these to units of spectral intensity (Janskys).  Total intensity differences have been eliminated by normalizing each spectrum to a mean value of 5000. This database was originally obtained for use in development and testing of our AutoClass system for Bayesian classification.  We have not retained any results from this development having concentrated our efforts of a 5425 element version of the same data.  Our classifications were based upon simultaneous modeling of all 93 spectral intensities. With the larger database we were able to find classes that correspond well with known spectral types associated with particular stellar types. We also found classes that match with the spectra expected of certain stellar processes under investigation by Ames astronomers.  These classes have considerably enlarged the set of stars being investigated by those researchers.   Original Data: The original fortran data file is given in spectra-2.data.  The file spectra-2.head contains information about the .data file contents and how to rescale the compressed spectral intensities.

KurganUniversity of Colorado at Denver Denver CO 80217 U.S.A.Krys.Cios '@' cudenver.edu  2. Lucy S. GoodendayMedical College of Ohio OH U.S.A. Donors:  Lukasz A.Kurgan Krzysztof J. Cios,The dataset describes diagnosing of cardiac Single Proton Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) images. Each of the patients is classified into two categories: normal and abnormal. The database of 267 SPECT image sets (patients) was processed to extract features that summarize the original SPECT images. As a result 44 continuous feature pattern was created for each patient. The CLIP3 algorithm was used to generate classification rules from these patterns. The CLIP3 algorithm generated rules that were 77.0% accurate (as compared with cardilogists' diagnoses).  SPECTF is a good data set for testing ML algorithms; it has 267 instances that are descibed by 45 attributes. Predicted attribute: OVERALL_DIAGNOSIS (binary)  NOTE: See the SPECT heart data for binary data for the same classification task.

Servo,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Servo,1993-05-01,Computer,64708,Creator: Karl Ulrich (MIT) Donor:  Ross Quinlan,Ross Quinlan: This data was given to me by Karl Ulrich at MIT in 1986.  I didn't record his description at the time but here's his subsequent (1992) recollection: "I seem to remember that the data was from a simulation of a servo system involving a servo amplifier a motor a lead screw/nut and a sliding carriage of some sort.  It may have been on of the translational axes of a robot on the 9th floor of the AI lab.  In any case the output value is almost certainly a rise time or the time required for the system to respond to a step change in a position set point." (Quinlan ML'93) "This is an interesting collection of data provided by Karl Ulrich.  It covers an extremely non-linear phenomenon - predicting the rise time of a servomechanism in terms of two (continuous) gain settings and two (discrete) choices of mechanical linkages."
Auto MPG,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG,1993-07-07,N/A,272654,This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University.

In line with the use by Ross Quinlan (1993) in predicting the attribute "mpg" 8 of the original instances were removed because they had unknown values for the "mpg" attribute.  The original dataset is available in the file "auto-mpg.data-original". "The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes." (Quinlan 1993)

Vicon Physical Action Data Set,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Vicon+Physical+Action+Data+Set,2011-07-27,Physical,36288,Theo TheodoridisSchool of Computer Science and Electronic EngineeringUniversity of EssexWivenhoe Park Colchester CO4 3SQ UKttheod '@' gmail.com http://sites.google.com/site/ttheod/,1. Protocol:   Seven male and three female subjects (age 25 to 30) who have experienced aggression in scenarios such   as physical fighting took part in the experiment. Throughout 20 individual experiments each subject   had to perform ten normal and ten aggressive activities. Regarding the rights of the subjects involved   ethical regulations have been followed based on the code of ethics of the British psychological society   which explains the ethical legislations to conduct statistical experiments using human subjects. For safety   precaution issues boxing hand wraps have been given to the subjects and for the warm up the subjects   were instructed to familiarise with the bag by having a number of trial runs. The subjects were aware that   since their involvement in this series of experiments was voluntary it was made clear that they could   withdraw at any time from the study. 2. Instrumentation:   The Essex robotic arena was the main experimental hall where the data collection took place. With area   4x5.5m the ten subjects expressed normal and aggressive physical activities at random locations. For the   normal actions a human partner has been used as a focus target attracting the attention from the subjects   so as to perform more realistic activity. For the aggressive actions the subjects made use of a professional   kick-boxing standing bag 1.75m tall with a human figure drawn on its body. The bag has cylindrical shape   made from soft material which could bounce when hit. All the activities have been recorded from random   starting positions so that to have a variety of spatial 3D data. The subjectsâ€™ performance has been recorded   by the Viconâ€™s nine ubiquitous cameras interfacing human activity with spatial coordinate points. Based on   this context the data acquisition process involved four reflectable markers placed on the forearms (elbows   and wrists) four on the forelegs (knees and ankles) and one on the top of the head. 3. Data Setup:   Each experimental trial has been taken separately for each physical activity. The duration of each action   was approximately ~10 seconds per subject which corresponds to a time series of ~3000 samples with   sampling frequency of 200Hz. Within this performance time approximately 15 action trajectories were   extracted counting in average 15 normal (ex: handshaking) and 15 aggressive (ex: punching) actions.

Firstly this was a two-hand system. Secondly each position tracker provided 6 degrees of freedom - i.e. roll pitch and yaw as well as x y and z. The gloves also provided a full five fingers of data. But the big improvements were in resolution - both accuracy and temporal. Position and orientation were defined to 14-bit accuracy giving position information with a typical positional error less than one centimetre and angle error less than one half of a degree. Finger bend was measured with 8 bits per finger of which probably 6 bits were usable once the glove was calibrated. The refresh rate of the complete system was close to 100 frames per second; and all signals had significantly less noise than the Nintendo data.  Samples from a single signer (a native Auslan signer) were collected over a period of nine weeks. In total 27 samples per sign and a total of 2565 signs were collected. The average length of each sign was approximately 57 frames.  The data was collected from a volunteer native Auslan signer  The data presented is the raw data with no filtering.  The file consists of 9 subdirectories tctodd1-9. Each directory consists of 3 samples of each sign captured on a different day. In total there are 95 different signs with 27 samples per sign. Signs were provided by a native signer volunteer.  Each file consists of a sequence of lines. Each line consists of 22 whitespace-separated numbers representing the 22 channels of information. The list of channels can be found in the domain description file. It also lists the classes. More information can be found here: [Web Link].

Bahcesehir University Department of Software Engineering 34381 Istanbul Turkey Phone: +90 (212) 381 0589 Email: betul.erdogdu '@' eng.bahcesehir.edu.tr,The PD and control handwriting database consists of 62 PWP (People with parkinson) and 15 healthy individuals who appealed at the Department of Neurology in Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine Istanbul University. From all subjects three types of handwriting recordings (Static Spiral Test (SST) Dynamic Spiral Test (DST) and Stability Test on Certain Point (STCP)) are taken. Also the drawings of spirals belongs to the PWP are included in the dataset as image. Therefore this dataset can also be used for regression.  Handwriting dataset was constructed using Wacom Cintiq 12WX graphics (Hahne et al. 2009) table. It is basically a graphics tablet and LCD monitor rolled into one. It enables to display a PC's screen on its monitor and only interacts with digitized pens. Special software was designed for recording handwriting drawings and testing the coordination of the PD patients using the recordings. The software uses API functions of the device and was developed in C# platform which can be run on Windows systems You can contact with the authors to request the software which is mentioned [1].  In this study there are three different kinds of tests developed for the data collection via graphics tablet. The first one isthe Static Spiral Test (SST) which is frequently used for clinical research in the literature for different purposes like determining motor performance (Wang et al. 2008) measuring tremor (Pullman 1998) and diagnosing PD (Saunders et al. 2008). In this test three wound Archimedean spirals appears on the graphics tablet using the software and patients were asked to retrace the same spiral as much as they can using the digital pen. During the test the features which are mentioned above and the other data to specify the patient are recorded to the database.  The second test is the Dynamic Spiral Test (DST). Unlike SST Archimedean spiral just appears and disappears in certain time intervals in other words the Archimedean spiral blinks. This forces the patient to keep the pattern in mind and continue to draw. The purpose of this test is to determine the change in patient's drawing performance and pause times since it is more difficult to retrace the Archimedean spiral in this case. As a result of this test it is observed that most of the patients continued drawing but nearly all of them lost the pattern.  The third test is Stability Test on Certain Point (STCP). In this test there is a certain red point in the middle of the screen and the subjects are asked to hold the digital pen on the point without touching the screen in a certain time. The purpose of this test is to determine the patient's hand stability or hand tremor level.

Vilanova i la Geltrú (08800) Spainactivityrecognition '@' smartlab.ws ,The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING WALKING_UPSTAIRS WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS SITTING STANDING LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal which has gravitational and body motion components was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.Check the README.txt file for further details about this dataset. A video of the experiment including an example of the 6 recorded activities with one of the participants can be seen in the following link: [Web Link]An updated version of this dataset can be found at [Web Link]. It includes labels of postural transitions between activities and also the full raw inertial signals instead of the ones pre-processed into windows.

The task is closely related to Quinlan's (1983) application of ID3 to classify White King and Rook against Black King and Knight (KRKN) positions as lost 2-ply or lost 3-ply. The framework is similar in that the example positions supply only low-grade data. An important difference is that additional background predicates of the kind supplied in the KRKN study via hand-crafted attributes are not provided for this KRK domain. Chess endgames are complex domains which are enumerable. Endgame databases are tables of stored game-theoretic values for the enumerated elements (legal positions) of the domain. The game-theoretic values stored denote whether or not positions are won for either side or include also the depth of win (number of moves) assuming minimax-optimal play. From the point of view of experiments on computer induction such databases provide not only a source of examples but also an oracle (Roycroft 1986) for testing induced rules. However a chess endgame database differs from say a relational database containing details of parts and suppliers in the following important respect. The combinatorics of computing the required game-theoretic values for individual position entries independently would be prohibitive. Therefore all the database entries are generated in a single iterative process using the ``standard backup'' algorithm (Thompson 1986). A KRK database was described by Clarke (1977). The current database was described and used for machine learning experiments in Bain (1992; 1994). It should be noted that our database is not guaranteed correct but the class distribution is the same as Clarke's database. In (Bain 1992; 1994) the task was classification of positions in the database as won for white in a fixed number of moves assuming optimal play by both sides. The problem was structured into separate sub-problems by depth-of-win ordered draw zero one ... sixteen. When learning depth d all examples at depths > d are used as negatives. Quinlan (1994) applied Foil to learn a complete and correct solution for this task. The typical complexity of induced classifiers in this domain suggest that the task is demanding when background knowledge is restricted.

These are consecutive patients seen by Dr. Wolberg since 1984 and include only those cases exhibiting invasive breast cancer and no evidence of distant metastases at the time of diagnosis.  The first 30 features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.  They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. A few of the images can be found at [Web Link]  The separation described above was obtained using Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T) [K. P. Bennett "Decision Tree Construction Via Linear Programming." Proceedings of the 4th Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Society pp. 97-101 1992] a classification method which uses linear programming to construct a decision tree.  Relevant features were selected using an exhaustive search in the space of 1-4 features and 1-3 separating planes. The actual linear program used to obtain the separating plane in the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets" Optimization Methods and Software 1 1992 23-34]. The Recurrence Surface Approximation (RSA) method is a linear programming model which predicts Time To Recur using both recurrent and nonrecurrent cases.  See references (i) and (ii) above for details of the RSA method.  This database is also available through the UW CS ftp server: ftp ftp.cs.wisc.educd math-prog/cpo-dataset/machine-learn/WPBC/
Molecular Biology (Protein Secondary Structure),https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Molecular+Biology+%28Protein+Secondary+Structure%29,N/A,Life,36931,The data set was contributed to the benchmark collection by Terry Sejnowski now at the Salk Institute and the University of California at San Deigo.  The data set was developed in collaboration with Ning Qian of Johns-Hopkins University.,This is a data set used by Ning Qian and Terry Sejnowski in their study using a neural net to predict the secondary structure of certain globular proteins [1].  The idea is to take a linear sequence of amino acids and to predict for each of these amino acids what secondary structure it is a part of within the protein.  There are three choices: alpha-helix beta-sheet and random-coil.  The data set contains both a large set of training data and a distinct set of data that can be used for testing the resulting network.  Qian and Sejnowski use a Nettalk-like approach and report an accuracy of 64.3% on the test set and they speculate that this is about the best that can be done using only local context. There is also a domain theory in the folder donated and created by Jude Shavlik & Rich Maclin

Original ownersThe data set was constructed from the MNIST data that is made available by Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes at http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. b. Donor of databaseThis version of the database was prepared for the NIPS 2003 variable and feature selection benchmark by Isabelle Guyon 955 Creston Road Berkeley CA 94708 USA (isabelle '@' clopinet.com).,The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image of dimension 28x28. The original data were modified for the purpose of the feature selection challenge. In particular pixels were samples at random in the middle top part of the feature containing the information necessary to disambiguate 4 from 9 and higher order features were created as products of these pixels to plunge the problem in a higher dimensional feature space. We also added a number of distractor features called 'probes' having no predictive power. The order of the features and patterns were randomized.

The#  README file (which you are reading) contains project information#  such as data collection techniques data organization and field#  naming convention.  In addition to the README file the archive#  contains a number of .csv files.  Each of these CSV files contains#  data aggregated by team from the project (see below) paired with#  that team's outcome for either the process or product component of#  the team's evaluation.

All students consented to this data#  being shared for research purposes provided no uniquely identifiable#  information was contained in the distributed files.  The information#  was collected through various means with emphasis being placed on#  the collection of objective quantifiable information.  For more#  information on the data collection procedures please see the paper#  referenced above.###  PRIVACY#  -------#  The data contained in this file does not contain any information#  which may be individually traced to a particular student who#  participated in the study.###  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DATA SOURCES AND DERIVATIONS#  -------------------------------------------------#  SAMs (Student Activity Measure) are collected for each student team#  member during their participation in a software engineering class.#  Student teams work together on a final class project and comprise#  5-6 students.  Teams that are made up of students from only one#  school are labeled local teams.  Teams made up of students from more#  than one school are labeled global teams.  SAMs are collected from:#  weekly timecards instructor observations and software engineering#  tool usage logs.  SAMs are then aggregated by team and time interval#  (see next section) into TAMs (Team Activity Measure).  Outcomes are#  determined at the end of the semester through evaluation of student#  team work in two categories:  software engineering process (how well#  the team applied best software engineering practices) and software#  engineering product (the quality of the finished product the team#  produced).  Thus for each team two outcomes are determined process#  and product respectively.  Outcomes are classified into two class#  grades A or F.  A represents teams that are at or above#  expectations F represents teams that are below expectations or need#  attention.  For more information please see the paper referenced#  above.##  The SE process and SE product outcomes represent ML training classes#  and are to be considered separately e.g. one should train ML for SE#  process separately from training for SE product.##  TIME INTERVALS FOR WHICH DATA IS COLLECTED#  ------------------------------------------#  Data collected continuously throughout the semester are aggregated#  into different time intervals for the semester's project reflecting#  different dynamics of teamwork during the class.  Time intervals#  represent time periods in which a milestone was developed by each#  team.  A milestone represents a major deliverable point in the class#  for all student teams.  The milestones are roughly divided into the#  following topics:##            M1 - high level requirements and specs#            M2 - more detailed requirements and specs#            M3 - first prototype#            M4 - beta release#            M5 - final delivery##  Time intervals are combinations of the time in which milestones are#  being produced.  Time intervals are used in research only.##  In addition to time intervals corresponding to milestones a number#  of time intervals combining multiple T1-T5 time intervals have been#  calculated.  This was done to group student activities into design#  vs. implementation phases which have different dynamics.##  These time intervals are defined as follows:##      Time Interval        Corresponding Milestone Periods in Class#    -----------------    --------------------------------------------#           0               Milestone 0#           1               Milestone 1#           2               Milestone 2#           3               Milestone 3#           4               Milestone 4#           5               Milestone 5#           6               Milestone 1 - Milestone 2 inclusive#           7               Milestone 1 - Milestone 3 inclusive#           8               Milestone 1 - Milestone 4 inclusive#           9               Milestone 1 - Milestone 5 inclusive#          10               Milestone 4 - Milestone 5 inclusive#          11               Milestone 3 - Milestone 5 inclusive####  SETAP PROJECT OVERALL DATA STATISTICS#  ================================================================== #  The following is a set of statistics about the entire dataset which#  may be useful in the configuration of machine learning methods.##  This data was collected only from students at SFSU.

TV News Channel Commercial Detection Dataset,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/TV+News+Channel+Commercial+Detection+Dataset,2015-03-27,Computer,36576,Dr. Prithwijit Guha  Raghvendra D. Kannao and Ravishankar SoniMultimedia Analytics Lab Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati Indiardkannao '@' gmail.com  prithwijit.guha '@' gmail.com ,Automatic identification of commercial blocks in news videos finds a lot of applications in the domain of television broadcast analysis and monitoring. Commercials occupy almost 40-60%  of total air time. Manual segmentation of commercials from thousands of TV news channels is time consuming and economically infeasible hence prompts the need for machine learning based Method. Classifying TV News commercials is a semantic video classification problem. TV News commercials on particular news channel are combinations of video shots uniquely characterized by audio-visual presentation. Hence various audio visual features extracted from video shots are widely used for TV commercial classification.  Indian News channels do not follow any particular news presentation format have large variability and  dynamic nature presenting a challenging machine learning problem.  Features from 150 Hours of broadcast news videos from 5 different ( 3 Indian and  2 International News channels)  news channels. Viz. CNNIBN NDTV 24X7 TIMESNOW BBC and CNN are presented in this dataset.  Videos are recorded at resolution of 720 X 576 at 25 fps  using a DVR and set top box. 3 Indian channels are recorded concurrently while 2 International are recorded together. Feature file preserves the order of occurrence of shots.

The differential diagnosis of erythemato-squamous diseases is a real problem in dermatology. They all share the clinical features of erythema and scaling with very little differences. The diseases in this group are psoriasis seboreic dermatitis lichen planus pityriasis rosea cronic dermatitis and pityriasis rubra pilaris. Usually a biopsy is necessary for the diagnosis but unfortunately these diseases share many histopathological features as well. Another difficulty for the differential diagnosis is that a disease may show the features of another disease at the beginning stage and may have the characteristic features at the following stages. Patients were first evaluated clinically with 12 features. Afterwards skin samples were taken for the evaluation of 22 histopathological features. The values of the histopathological features are determined by an analysis of the samples under a microscope.  In the dataset constructed for this domain the family history feature has the value 1 if any of these diseases has been observed in the family and 0 otherwise. The age feature simply represents the age of the patient. Every other feature (clinical and histopathological) was given a degree in the range of 0 to 3. Here 0 indicates that the feature was not present 3 indicates the largest amount possible and 1 2 indicate the relative intermediate values. The names and id numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database.
Moral Reasoner,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Moral+Reasoner,1994-06-01,Computer,24340,Creators:  T.R. Shultz & J.M. Daley  Donor:  James L. Wogulis University of California IrvineIrvine CA USA,This is a rule-based model that qualitatively simulates moral reasoning. The model was intended to simulate how an ordinary person down to about age five reasons about harm-doing. The horn-clause theory and the 202 instances are the same as were used in (Wogulis 1994).  The top-level predicate to predict is guilty/1. For more information e.g. on the generation of instances see (Wogulis 1994).
MONK's Problems,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MONK%27s+Problems,1992-10-01,N/A,161969,Donor:  Sebastian ThrunSchool of Computer ScienceCarnegie Mellon UniversityPittsburgh PA 15213 USAE-mail: thrun '@' cs.cmu.edu,The MONK's problem were the basis of a first international comparison of learning algorithms. The result of this comparison is summarized in "The MONK's Problems - A Performance Comparison of Different Learning algorithms" by S.B. Thrun J. Bala E. Bloedorn I.  Bratko B. Cestnik J. Cheng K. De Jong S.  Dzeroski S.E. Fahlman D. Fisher R. Hamann K. Kaufman S. Keller I. Kononenko J.  Kreuziger R.S. Michalski T. Mitchell P.  Pachowicz Y. Reich H.  Vafaie W. Van de Welde W. Wenzel J. Wnek and J. Zhang has been published as Technical Report CS-CMU-91-197 Carnegie Mellon University in Dec. 1991. One significant characteristic of this comparison is that it was performed by a collection of researchers each of whom was an advocate of the technique they tested (often they were the creators of the various methods). In this sense the results are less biased than in comparisons performed by a single person advocating a specific learning method and more accurately reflect the generalization behavior of the learning techniques as applied by knowledgeable users. There are three MONK's problems.  The domains for all MONK's problems are the same (described below).  One of the MONK's problems has noise added. For each problem the domain has been partitioned into a train and test set.

The goal is to learn to predict whether new molecules will be musks or non-musks.  However the 166 features that describe these molecules depend upon the exact shape or conformation of the molecule.  Because bonds can rotate a single molecule can adopt many different shapes.  To generate this data set the low-energy conformations of the molecules were generated and then filtered to remove highly similar conformations. This left 476 conformations.  Then a feature vector was extracted that describes each conformation. This many-to-one relationship between feature vectors and molecules is called the "multiple instance problem".  When learning a classifier for this data the classifier should classify a molecule as "musk" if ANY of its conformations is classified as a musk.  A molecule should be classified as "non-musk" if NONE of its conformations is classified as a musk.

Concerning the study of H. Altay Guvenir: "The aim is to distinguish between the presence and absence of cardiac arrhythmia and to classify it in one of the 16 groups. Class 01 refers to 'normal' ECG classes 02 to 15 refers to different classes of arrhythmia and class 16 refers to the rest of unclassified ones. For the time being there exists a computer program that makes such a classification. However there are differences between the cardiolog's and the programs classification. Taking the cardiolog's as a gold standard we aim to minimise this difference by means of machine learning tools." The names and id numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database.

First they cannot identify the relations between weights of stock-picking concepts and performances of portfolios. Second they cannot systematically discover the optimal combination for weights of concepts to optimize the performances. Third they are unable to meet various investorsâ€™ preferences. This study aims to more efficiently construct weighted scoring stock selection models to overcome these disadvantages. Since the weights of stock-picking concepts in a weighted scoring stock selection model can be regarded as components in a mixture we used the simplex centroid mixture design to obtain the experimental sets of weights. These sets of weights are simulated with US stock market historical data to obtain their performances. Performance prediction models were built with the simulated performance data set and artificial neural networks. Furthermore the optimization models to reflect investorsâ€™ preferences were built up and the performance prediction models were employed as the kernel of the optimization models so that the optimal solutions can now be solved with optimization techniques. The empirical values of the performances of the optimal weighting combinations generated by the optimization models showed that they can meet various investorsâ€™ preferences and outperform those of S&Pâ€™s 500 not only during the training period but also during the testing period.

In this scenarios recent advancements in wearable technologies particularly smartwatches with built-in sensors and personal devices such as smartphones are being seen as the breakthrough for making concrete the envisioned Smart Environment (SE) paradigm.  In particular scenarios devoted to indoor localization represent a key challenge to be addressed. Many works try to solve the indoor localization issue but the lack of a common dataset or frameworks to compare and evaluate solutions represent a big barrier to be overcome in the ï¬eld. The unavailability and uncertainty of public datasets hinders the  possibility to compare different indoor localization algorithms. This constitutes the main motivation of the proposed dataset described herein.  We collected Wi-Fi and geo-magnetic ï¬eld ï¬ngerprints together with inertial sensor data during two campaigns performed in the same environment. Retrieving syncronized data from a smartwatch and a smartphone worn by users at the purpose of create and present a public available dataset is the goal of this work.

Gastrointestinal Lesions in Regular Colonoscopy,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gastrointestinal+Lesions+in+Regular+Colonoscopy,2016-10-15,Computer,1018,Pablo Mesejo pablomesejo '@' gmail.com Inria FranceDaniel Pizarro dani.pizarro '@' gmail.com University of AlcalÃ¡ Spain,This dataset contains the features extracted from a database of colonoscopic videos showing gastrointestinal lesions. It also contains the ground truth collected from both expert image inspection and histology (in an xlsx file). There are features vectors for 76 lesions and there are 3 types of lesion: hyperplasic adenoma and serrated adenoma. It is possible to consider this classification problem as a binary one by combining adenoma and serrated adenoma in the same class. According to this hyperplasic lesions would belong to the class 'benign' while the other two types of gastrointestinal lesions would go to the 'malignant' class.  The first line/row of the dataset corresponds to the lesion name (text label). Every lesion appears twice because it has been recorded using two types of lights: white light (WL) and narrow band imaging (NBI). The second line/row represents the type of lesion (3 for adenoma 1 for hyperplasic and 2 for serrated). And finally the third line/row is the type of light used (1 for WL and 2 for NBI). All other rows are the raw features (without any kind of preprocessing):422 2D TEXTURAL FEATURES- First 166 features: AHT: Autocorrelation Homogeneous Texture (Invariant Gabor Texture)- Next 256: Rotational Invariant LBP76 2D COLOR FEATURES- 16 Color Naming- 13 Discriminative Color- 7 Hue- 7 Opponent- 33 color gray-level co-occurrence matrix200 3D SHAPE FEATURES- 100 shapeDNA- 100 KPCA The main objective of this dataset is to study how good computers can be at diagnosing gastrointestinal lesions from regular colonoscopic videos. In order to compare the performance of machine learning methods with the one offered by humans we provide the file ground_truth.xlsx that includes the ground truth after histopathology and the opinion of 7 clinicians (4 experts and 3 beginners). An automatic tissue classification approach could save clinician's time by avoiding chromoendoscopy a time-consuming staining procedure using indigo carmine as well as could help to assess the severity of individual lesions in patients with many polyps so that the gastroenterologist would directly focus on those requiring polypectomy. A possible way of proceeding with the classification is to concatenate the information from the two types of light for each lesion i.e. create a single vector of 1396 elements per lesion. The technical goal is to maximize accuracy while minimizing false positives (lesions that do not need resection but that are classified as if they do) and false negatives (lesions that do need resection but that are classified as if they do not need it). In particular we are specially interested on maximizing accuracy while reducing false negatives i.e. minimizing the number of adenoma and serrated adenoma that are classified as hyperplasic. The opposite case is not that serious: the resection of a hyperplasic polyp considering it as an adenoma or serrated adenoma. Another interesting experiment would consist on compare the performance of the best machine learning method we can get with the one provided by human operators (experts and beginners). The best results obtained so far in the binary case using leave-one-out and Random Forest with 1000 trees (using color+texture+3D with NBI) corresponded to an accuracy of ~895% sensitivity ~945% and specificity ~76% (considering as positive condition the resection).

Communities and Crime Unnormalized,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Communities+and+Crime+Unnormalized,2011-03-02,Social,83549,  -- Creator: Michael Redmond (redmond 'at' lasalle.edu); Computer Science; La Salle University; Philadelphia PA 19141 USA    -- culled from 1990 US Census 1995 US FBI Uniform Crime Report 1990 US Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics Survey available from ICPSR at U of Michigan.  -- Donor: Michael Redmond (redmond 'at' lasalle.edu); Computer Science; La Salle University; Philadelphia PA 19141 USA,The source datasets needed to be combined via programming. Many variables are included so that algorithms that select or learn weights for attributes could be tested. However clearly unrelated attributes were not included; attributes were picked if there was any plausible connection to crime (N=125) plus the crime variables which are potential dependent variables. The variables included in the dataset involve the community such as the percent of the population considered urban and the median family income and involving law enforcement such as per capita number of police officers and percent of officers assigned to drug units. The crime attributes (N=18) that could be predicted are the 8 crimes considered 'Index Crimes' by the FBI)(Murders Rape Robbery .... ) per capita (actually per 100000 population) versions of each and Per Capita Violent Crimes and Per Capita Nonviolent Crimes).  A limitation was that the LEMAS survey was of the police departments with at least 100 officers plus a random sample of smaller departments. For our purposes communities not found in both census and crime datasets were omitted. Many communities are missing LEMAS data. The per capita crimes variables were calculated using population values included in the 1995 FBI data (which differ from the 1990 Census values).  The per capita violent crimes variable was calculated using population and the sum of crime variables considered violent crimes in the United States: murder rape robbery and assault. There was apparently some controversy in some states concerning the counting of rapes. These resulted in missing values for rape which resulted in missing values for per capita violent crime. Many of these omitted communities were from the midwestern USA (Minnesota Illinois and Michigan have many of these).   The per capita nonviolent crime variable was calculated using the sum of crime variables considered non-violent crimes in the United States: burglaries larcenies auto thefts and arsons. (There are many other types of crimes these only include FBI 'Index Crimes') Some further pre-processing of the dataset must be done. Choose the desirable dependent variable from among the 18 possible. It would not be interesting or appropriate to predict total crime (e.g. violent crime) while including subtotals (e.g. murders) as independent variables. There are also identifying variables (community name county code community code) that are not predictive and would get in the way of some algorithms. Weka's Unsupervised Attribute Remove Filter can be used to remove unwanted attributes. The FBI notes that use of this data to evaluate communities is over-simplistic as many relevant factors are not included. For one example communities with large numbers of visitors will have higher per capita crime (measured by residents) than communities with fewer visitors other things being equal.

Diabetes,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes,N/A,Life,228464,Michael Kahn MD PhD Washington University St. Louis MO,Diabetes patient records were obtained from two sources:  an automatic electronic recording device and paper records.  The automatic device had an internal clock to timestamp events whereas the paper records only provided "logical time" slots (breakfast lunch dinner bedtime).  For paper records fixed times were assigned to breakfast (08:00) lunch (12:00) dinner (18:00) and bedtime (22:00).  Thus paper records have fictitious uniform recording times whereas electronic records have more realistic time stamps. Diabetes files consist of four fields per record.  Each field is separated by a tab and each record is separated by a newline. File Names and format:(1) Date in MM-DD-YYYY format(2) Time in XX:YY format(3) Code(4) Value The Code field is deciphered as follows: 33 = Regular insulin dose34 = NPH insulin dose35 = UltraLente insulin dose48 = Unspecified blood glucose measurement57 = Unspecified blood glucose measurement58 = Pre-breakfast blood glucose measurement59 = Post-breakfast blood glucose measurement60 = Pre-lunch blood glucose measurement61 = Post-lunch blood glucose measurement62 = Pre-supper blood glucose measurement63 = Post-supper blood glucose measurement64 = Pre-snack blood glucose measurement65 = Hypoglycemic symptoms66 = Typical meal ingestion67 = More-than-usual meal ingestion68 = Less-than-usual meal ingestion69 = Typical exercise activity70 = More-than-usual exercise activity71 = Less-than-usual exercise activity72 = Unspecified special event

The goal is to achieve good performance (or as low degradation as possible) over time as reported in the paper mentioned below in Section 2: Data collection. The primary purpose of providing this dataset is to make it freely accessible on-line to the chemo-sensor research community and artificial intelligence to develop strategies to cope with sensor/concept drift. The dataset can be used exclusively for research purposes. Commercial purposes are fully excluded.The dataset was gathered within January 2007 to February 2011 (36 months) in a gas delivery platform facility situated at the ChemoSignals Laboratory in the BioCircuits Institute University of California San Diego. Being completely operated by a fully computerized environment â€”controlled by a LabVIEWâ€“National Instruments software on a PC fitted with the appropriate serial data acquisition boards. The measurement system platform provides versatility for obtaining the desired concentrations of the chemical substances of interest with high accuracy and in a highly reproducible manner minimizing thereby the common mistakes caused by human intervention and making it possible to exclusively concentrate on the chemical sensors for compensating real drift.The resulting dataset comprises recordings from six distinct pure gaseous substances namely Ammonia Acetaldehyde Acetone Ethylene Ethanol and Toluene each dosed at a wide variety of concentration values ranging from 5 to 1000 ppmv. See Tables 1 and 2 of the below cited manuscript for details on the gas identity name concentration values and time distribution sequence of the measurement recordings considered in this dataset.Batch10.dat was updated on 10/14/2013 to correct some corrupted values in the last 120 lines of the file.An extension of this dataset with the concentration values is available at Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset at Different Concentrations Data Set [Web Link]

Vilanova i la GeltrÃº (08800) Spainhar '@' smartlab.ws www.smartlab.ws,The experiments were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. They performed a protocol of activities composed of six basic activities: three static postures (standing sitting lying) and three dynamic activities (walking walking downstairs and walking upstairs). The experiment also included postural transitions that occurred between the static postures. These are: stand-to-sit sit-to-stand sit-to-lie lie-to-sit stand-to-lie and lie-to-stand. All the participants were wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist during the experiment execution. We captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz using the embedded accelerometer and gyroscope of the device. The experiments were video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.  The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal which has gravitational and body motion components was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window a vector of 561 features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.  This dataset is an updated version of the UCI Human Activity Recognition Using smartphones Dataset that can be found at: [Web Link] This version provides the original raw inertial signals from the smartphone sensors instead of the ones pre-processed into windows which were provided in version 1. This change was done in order to be able to make online tests with the raw data. Moreover the activity labels were updated in order to include postural transitions that were not part of the previous version of the dataset.

Northix is the resulting schema matching of two demonstration databases namely Northwind and Sakila. Some unnecessary database entities (columns) such as multimedia were deleted. It was desired to have at least around 200 tuples per database entity; therefore tuples were randomly injected respecting the existing pattern if the number of tuples was low. The schema matching was done manually. The ideal entities matching are grouped into classes. In total there are 115 input database entities stored respectively as '.dat' from the first database and as '.txt' if from the second database. The file naming pattern is attributeName@ColumnName@Database. After schema matching the files are grouped into 34 classes (folders). 33 classes are ideal matchings whereas the class 'UNCLASSED' groups all the attributes that are unique and donâ€™t have another similar attribute. The attributes are of different data types such as texts integers real numbers dates and alphanumeric data types. In total there are 21805 tokens.

The TAO array consists of nearly 70 moored buoys spanning the equatorial Pacific measuring oceanographic and surface meteorological variables critical for improved detection understanding and prediction of seasonal-to-interannual climate variations originating in the tropics most notably those related to the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycles.  The moorings were developed by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL). Each mooring measures air temperature relative humidity surface winds sea surface temperatures and subsurface temperatures down to a depth of 500 meters and a few a of the buoys measure currents rainfall and solar radiation. The data from the array and current updates can be viewed on the web at the this address .  The El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle of 1982-1983 the strongest of the century created many problems throughout the world. Parts of the world such as Peru and the Unites States experienced destructive flooding from increased rainfalls while the western Pacific areas experienced drought and devastating brush fires. The ENSO cycle was neither predicted nor detected until it was near its peak. This highlighted the need for an ocean observing system (i.e. the TAO array) to support studies of large scale ocean-atmosphere interactions on seasonal-to-interannual time scales.  The TAO array provides real-time data to climate researchers weather prediction centers and scientists around the world. Forcasts for tropical Pacific Ocean temperatures for one to two years in advance can be made using the ENSO cycle data. These forcasts are possible because of the moored buoys along with drifting buoys volunteer ship temperature probes and sea level measurements.  Research questions of interest include:  - How can the data be used to predict weather conditions throughout the world? - How do the variables relate to each other? - Which variables have a greater effect on the climate variations? - Does the amount of movement of the buoy effect the reliability of the data? - When performing an analysis of the data one should pay attention the possible affect of autocorrelation. Using a multiple regression approach to model the data would require a look at autoregression since the weather statistics of the previous days will affect today's weather.  The data is stored in an ASCII files with one observation per line. Spaces separate fields and periods (.) denote missing values.

(13 experts) Donors:  Marko Bohanec   (marko.bohanec '@' ijs.si)Blaz Zupan      (blaz.zupan '@' ijs.si),Nursery Database was derived from a hierarchical decision model originally developed to rank applications for nursery schools. It was used during several years in 1980's when there was excessive enrollment to these schools in Ljubljana Slovenia and the rejected applications frequently needed an objective explanation. The final decision depended on three subproblems: occupation of parents and child's nursery family structure and financial standing and social and health picture of the family. The model was developed within expert system shell for decision making DEX (M. Bohanec V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision making. Sistemica 1(1) pp. 145-157 1990.). The hierarchical model ranks nursery-school applications according to the following concept structure:  NURSERY            Evaluation of applications for nursery schools . EMPLOY           Employment of parents and child's nursery . . parents        Parents' occupation . . has_nurs       Child's nursery . STRUCT_FINAN     Family structure and financial standings . .

Besides the target concept (NURSERY) the model includes four intermediate concepts: EMPLOY STRUCT_FINAN STRUCTURE SOC_HEALTH. Every concept is in the original model related to its lower level descendants by a set of examples (for these examples sets see [Web Link]). The Nursery Database contains examples with the structural information removed i.e. directly relates NURSERY to the eight input attributes: parents has_nurs form children housing finance social health.

The vehicle may be viewed from one of many different angles.   HISTORY: This data was originally gathered at the TI in 1986-87 by JP Siebert. It was partially financed by Barr and Stroud Ltd. The original purpose was to find a method of distinguishing 3D objects within a 2D image by application of an ensemble of shape feature extractors to the 2D silhouettes of the objects. Measures of shape features extracted from example silhouettes of objects to be discriminated were used to generate a classification rule tree by means of computer induction. This object recognition strategy was successfully used to discriminate between silhouettes of model cars vans and buses viewed from constrained elevation but all angles of rotation. The rule tree classification performance compared favourably to MDC (Minimum Distance Classifier) and k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbour) statistical classifiers in terms of both error rate and computational efficiency. An investigation of these rule trees generated by example indicated that the tree structure was heavily influenced by the orientation of the objects and grouped similar object views into single decisions.  DESCRIPTION: The features were extracted from the silhouettes by the HIPS (Hierarchical Image Processing System) extension BINATTS which extracts a combination of scale independent features utilising both classical moments based measures such as scaled variance skewness and kurtosis about the major/minor axes and heuristic measures such as hollows circularity rectangularity and compactness. Four "Corgie" model vehicles were used for the experiment: a double decker bus Cheverolet van Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400. This particular combination of vehicles was chosen with the expectation that the bus van and either one of the cars would be readily distinguishable but it would be more difficult to distinguish between the cars. The images were acquired by a camera looking downwards at the model vehicle from a fixed angle of elevation (34.2 degrees to the horizontal). The vehicles were placed on a diffuse backlit surface (lightbox). The vehicles were painted matte black to minimise highlights. The images were captured using a CRS4000 framestore connected to a vax 750. All images were captured with a spatial resolution of 128x128 pixels quantised to 64 greylevels. These images were thresholded to produce binary vehicle silhouettes negated (to comply with the processing requirements of BINATTS) and thereafter subjected to shrink-expand-expand-shrink HIPS modules to remove "salt and pepper" image noise. The vehicles were rotated and their angle of orientation was measured using a radial graticule beneath the vehicle. 0 and 180 degrees corresponded to "head on" and "rear" views respectively while 90 and 270 corresponded to profiles in opposite directions. Two sets of 60 images each set covering a full 360 degree rotation were captured for each vehicle. The vehicle was rotated by a fixed angle between images. These datasets are known as e2 and e3 respectively.  A further two sets of images e4 and e5 were captured with the camera at elevations of 37.5 degs and 30.8 degs respectively. These sets also contain 60 images per vehicle apart from e4.van which contains only 46 owing to the difficulty of containing the van in the image at some orientations.

A special case of such threat is a seismic hazard which frequently occurs in many underground mines. Seismic hazard is the hardest detectable and predictable of natural hazards and in this respect it is comparable to an earthquake. More and more advanced seismic and seismoacoustic monitoring systems allow a better understanding rock mass processes and definition of seismic hazard prediction methods. Accuracy of so far created methods is however far from perfect. Complexity of seismic processes and big disproportion between the number of low-energy seismic events and the number of high-energy phenomena (e.g. > 10^4J) causes the statistical techniques to be insufficient to predict seismic hazard. Therefore it is essential to search for new opportunities of better hazard prediction also using machine learning methods. In seismic hazard assessment data clustering techniques can be applied (Lesniak A. Isakow Z.: Space-time clustering of seismic events and hazard assessment in the Zabrze-Bielszowice coal mine Poland. Int. Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences 46(5) 2009 918-928) and for prediction of seismic tremors artificial neural networks are used (Kabiesz J.: Effect of the form of data on the quality of mine tremors hazard forecasting using neural networks. Geotechnical and Geological Engineering 24(5) 2005 1131-1147). In the majority of applications the results obtained by mentioned methods are reported in the form of two states which are interpreted as 'hazardous' and 'non-hazardous'. Unbalanced distribution of positive ('hazardous state') and negative ('non-hazardous state') examples is a serious problem in seismic hazard prediction. Currently used methods are still insufficient to achieve good sensitivity and specificity of predictions. In the paper (Bukowska M.: The probability of rockburst occurrence in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin area dependent on natural mining conditions. Journal of Mining Sciences 42(6) 2006 570-577) a number of factors having an effect on seismic hazard occurrence was proposed among other factors the occurrence of tremors with energy > 10^4J was listed. The task of seismic prediction can be defined in different ways but the main aim of all seismic hazard assessment methods is to predict (with given precision relating to time and date) of increased seismic activity which can cause a rockburst. In the data set each row contains a summary statement about seismic activity in the rock mass within one shift (8 hours). If decision attribute has the value 1 then in the next shift any seismic bump with an energy higher than 10^4 J was registered. That task of hazards prediction bases on the relationship between the energy of recorded tremors and seismoacoustic activity with the possibility of rockburst occurrence. Hence such hazard prognosis is not connected with accurate rockburst prediction. Moreover with the information about the possibility of hazardous situation occurrence an appropriate supervision service can reduce a risk of rockburst (e.g. by distressing shooting) or withdraw workers from the threatened area. Good prediction of increased seismic activity is therefore a matter of great practical importance.   The presented data set is characterized by unbalanced distribution of positive and negative examples. In the data set there are only 170 positive examples representing class 1.

SECOM,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SECOM,2008-11-19,Computer,53418,Authors: Michael McCann Adrian Johnston ,A complex modern semi-conductor manufacturing process is normally under consistent surveillance via the monitoring of signals/variables collected from sensors and or process measurement points. However not all of these signals are equally valuable in a specific monitoring system. The measured signals contain a combination of useful information irrelevant information as well as noise. It is often the case that useful information is buried in the latter two. Engineers typically have a much larger number of signals than are actually required. If we consider each type of signal as a feature then feature selection may be applied to identify the most relevant signals. The Process Engineers may then use these signals to determine key factors contributing to yield excursions downstream in the process. This will enable an increase in process throughput decreased time to learning and reduce the per unit production costs. To enhance current business improvement techniques the application of feature selection as an intelligent systems technique is being investigated. The dataset presented in this case represents a selection of such features where each example represents a single production entity with associated measured features and the labels represent a simple pass/fail yield for in house line testing figure 2 and associated date time stamp. Where â€“1 corresponds to a pass and 1 corresponds to a fail and the data time stamp is for that specific test point.  Using feature selection techniques it is desired to rank features according to their impact on the overall yield for the product causal relationships may also be considered with a view to identifying the key features. Results may be submitted in terms of feature relevance for predictability using error rates as our evaluation metrics. It is suggested that cross validation be applied to generate these results. Some baseline results are shown below for basic feature selection techniques using a simple kernel ridge classifier and 10 fold cross validation. Baseline Results: Pre-processing objects were applied to the dataset simply to standardize the data and remove the constant features and then a number of different feature selection objects selecting 40 highest ranked features were applied with a simple classifier to achieve some initial results. 10 fold cross validation was used and the balanced error rate (*BER) generated as our initial performance metric to help investigate this dataset.

These signatures are learned from Monte Carlo simulations of the collisions that produce these particles and the resulting decay products. In each of the three data sets here the goal is to separate particle-producing collisions from a background source.  The mass of the new particle is unknown so three separate data sets are provided. In each data set 50% of the data is from a signal process while 50% is from the background process. The data is separated into a training set of 7 million examples and a test set of 3.5 million for each. 1) In the '1000' dataset the signal particle has mass=1000. (Note: this dataset does not include a mass feature since all signal examples have the same mass.) 2) In the 'not1000' dataset the signal particle's mass is drawn uniformly from the set {500 750 1250 1500}. The mass is included as an input feature; for the background examples the mass is selected randomly from this same set. 3) In the 'all' dataset the signal particle's mass is drawn uniformly from the set {500 750 1000 1250 1500}. The mass is included as an input feature; for the background examples the mass is selected randomly from this same set.

Anderson (anderson '@' cs.colostate.edu)Associate ProfessorDepartment of Computer ScienceColorado State UniversityFort Collins CO  80523  USA,Predicting forest cover type from cartographic variables only (no remotely sensed data).  The actual forest cover type for a given observation (30 x 30 meter cell) was determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System (RIS) data.  Independent variables were derived from data originally obtained from US Geological Survey (USGS) and USFS data.  Data is in raw form (not scaled) and contains binary (0 or 1) columns of data for qualitative independent variables (wilderness areas and soil types). This study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado.  These areas represent forests with minimal human-caused disturbances so that existing forest cover types are more a result of ecological processes rather than forest management practices. Some background information for these four wilderness areas: Neota (area 2) probably has the highest mean elevational value of the 4 wilderness areas. Rawah (area 1) and Comanche Peak (area 3) would have a lower mean elevational value while Cache la Poudre (area 4) would have the lowest mean elevational value.  As for primary major tree species in these areas Neota would have spruce/fir (type 1) while Rawah and Comanche Peak would probably have lodgepole pine (type 2) as their primary species followed by spruce/fir and aspen (type 5). Cache la Poudre would tend to have Ponderosa pine (type 3) Douglas-fir (type 6) and cottonwood/willow (type 4).   The Rawah and Comanche Peak areas would tend to be more typical of the overall dataset than either the Neota or Cache la Poudre due to their assortment of tree species and range of predictive variable values (elevation etc.)  Cache la Poudre would probably  be more unique than the others due to its relatively low  elevation range and species composition.

This dataset is an extension of the Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset ([Web Link]) providing now the information about the concentration level at which the sensors were exposed for each measurement. The primary purpose of making this dataset freely accessible on-line is to provide an extensive dataset to the sensor and artificial intelligence research communities to develop and test strategies to solve a wide variety of tasks including sensor drift classification regression among others.  The dataset can be used exclusively for research purposes. Commercial purposes are fully excluded. Citation of both Vergara et al. 'Chemical gas sensor drift compensation using classifier ensembles' and Rodriguez-Lujan et al. â€œOn the calibration of sensor arrays for pattern recognition using the minimal number of experimentsâ€ is required (see below). The dataset was gathered during the period of January 2008 to February 2011 (36 months) in a gas delivery platform facility situated at the ChemoSignals Laboratory in the BioCircuits Institute University of California San Diego. The measurement system platform provides versatility for obtaining the desired concentrations of the chemical substances of interest with high accuracy and in a highly reproducible manner minimizing thereby the common mistakes caused by human intervention and making it possible to exclusively concentrate on the chemical sensors. See reference 1 for more details on the experimental setup.  The resulting dataset comprises recordings from six distinct pure gaseous substances namely Ammonia Acetaldehyde Acetone Ethylene Ethanol and Toluene dosed at a wide variety of concentration levels in the intervals (501000) (5500) (121000) (10300) (10600) and (10100) ppmv respectively.

Recently process delays known as cylinder banding in rotogravure printing were substantially mitigated using control rules discovered by decision tree induction. Our work exemplifies a more general methodology which transforms the knowledge acquisition task from one in which rules are directly elicited from an expert to one in which a learning system is responsible for rule generation. The primary responsibilities of the human expert are to evaluate the merits of generated rules and to guide the acquisition and classification of data necessary for machine induction. These responsibilities require the expert to do what an expert does best: to exercise his or her expertise. This seems a more natural fit to an expert's capabilities than the requirements of traditional methodologies that experts explicitly enumerate the rules that they employ.

The raw HTML-documents of the blog posts were crawled and processed. The prediction task associated with the data is the prediction of the number of comments in the upcoming 24 hours. In order to simulate this situation we choose a basetime (in the past) and select the blog posts that were published at most72 hours before the selected base date/time. Then we calculateall the features of the selected blog posts from the information that was available at the basetime therefore each instance corresponds to a blog post. The target is the number of comments that the blog post received in the next 24 hours relative to the basetime.  In the train data the basetimes were in the years 2010 and 2011. In the test data the basetimes were in February and March 2012. This simulates the real-world situtation in which training data from the past is available to predict events in the future. The train data was generated from different basetimes that may temporally overlap. Therefore if you simply split the train into disjoint partitions the underlying time intervals may overlap. Therefore the you should use the provided temporally disjoint train and test splits in order to ensure that theevaluation is fair.

Box 402603Maimi FL 33140-0603,All the patients suffered heart attacks at some point in the past. Some are still alive and some are not.  The survival and still-alive variables when taken together indicate whether a patient survived for at least one year following the heart attack.   The problem addressed by past researchers was to predict from the other variables whether or not the patient will survive at least one year.  The most difficult part of this problem is correctly predicting that the patient will NOT survive.  (Part of the difficulty seems to be the size of the data set.)

Donors: Chris Meek Microsoft meek '@' microsoft.com Bo Thiesson Microsoft thiesson '@' microsoft.com David Heckerman Microsoft heckerma '@' microsoft.com ,The data was collected as part of the 1990 census.  There are 68 categorical attributes. This data set was derived from the USCensus1990raw data set. The attributes are listed in the file USCensus1990.attributes.txt (repeated below) and the coding for the values is described below. Many of the less useful attributes in the original data set have been dropped the few continuous variables have been discretized and the few discrete variables that have a large number of possible values have been collapsed to have fewer possible values.  More specifically the USCensus1990 data set was obtained from the USCensus1990raw data set by the following sequence of operations;  - Randomization: The order of the cases in the original USCensus1990raw data set were randomly permuted. - Selection of attributes: The 68 attributes included in the data set are given below. In the USCensus1990 data set we have added a single letter prefix to the original name. We add the letter 'i' to indicate that the original attribute values are used and 'd' to indicate that original attribute values for each case have been mapped to new values (the precise mapping is described below).  Hierarchies of values are provided in the file USCensus1990raw.coding.htm and the mapping functions used to transform the USCensus1990raw to the USCensus1990 data sets are giving in the file USCensus1990.mapping.sql.

In this case each attribute value has the 10% probability of having its value inverted.   It's valuable to know the optimal Bayes rate for these databases. In this case the misclassification rate is 26% (74% classification accuracy).

The complete lexicon is as follows:66 letters (33 per case): The 52 ASCII letters. The 14 Spanish non-ASCII letters:Letter n with tilde (2 characters). Vowels with acute accent (10 characters). Letter u with diaeresis (2 characters). The 10 digits.Other 21 characters: The 16 ASCII ones shown in the following line:            .  ; : ? ! ' ' ( ) % - @ $ < > 5 non-ASCII ones: Inverted question and exclamation marks (2 characters). Masculine and feminine ordinal indicators (2 characters). The euro sign (1 character). So the total number of samples in this database is 11640:  60 writers x (66+10+21) characters x 2 repetitions UJIpenchars is a subset of UJIpenchars2 with only 1364 samples: the ASCII letters and digits collected at UJI during the 1st acquisition phase. We have not defined a standard task for UJIpenchars2 but divided the writer set into two disjoint subsets in order to ease the definition of writer independent tasks:40 'trn' writers: The 11 1st phase UJI writers. 29 UPV writers.20 'tst' writers: The 5 2nd phase UJI writers. 15 UPV writers.The distribution of our database consists of 2 files: This 'uji2.names'. The file 'ujipenchars2.txt' containing all the samples in a format described later.The handwriting samples were collected on a Toshiba Portégé M400 Tablet PC using its cordless stylus. Each one of the 60 writers completed 2 non-consecutive sessions. In each session the corresponding writer was asked to write one exemplar for each character in the lexicon. The acquisition program shows a set of boxes on the screen one for each required character and writers are told to write only inside those boxes. Each acquisition box is approximately 13.6 millimetres wide and 20.4 millimetres tall and contais two horizontal guides at approximate distances of 7.5 and 12.7 millimetres from top respectively. Writers were instructed to clear the content of the corresponding box by using an on-screen button and try again whenever they made a mistake or were unhappy with the writing of any character. Subjects were monitored only when writing their first exemplars and every sample considered OK by its writer was accepted even if some of its points lay out of the corresponding acquisition box. Only X and Y coordinate information was recorded along the strokes by the acquisition program without for instance pressure level values or timing information. Thus in multi-stroke samples no information at all was recorded between strokes. Both coordinates were expressed as integer ink units with the origin lying at the top left corner of the corresponding acquisition box. X values grow left-to-right and Y values grow downwards. Although we have employed the same acquisition program on identical hardware at UJI and UPV we have observed that acquisition files seem to show that UPV samples have been collected using acquisition boxes larger than UJI ones. This is due to a different configuration parameter value that at UPV makes the acquisition program translate 1 millimetre into 152 ink units instead of using the standard UJI ratio: 100 ink units per millimetre. If box homogenisation is needed it can be easily achieved for instance by dividing UPV coordinate values by 1.52. We have also observed that runs of consecutive points with identical coordinates were frequently acquired inside strokes; such runs were preserved in this database so it is up to its users to decide whether to avoid them by an appropriate preprocessing step or not.

The goal is to learn to predict whether new molecules will be musks or non-musks.  However the 166 features that describe these molecules depend upon the exact shape or conformation of the molecule.  Because bonds can rotate a single molecule can adopt many different shapes.  To generate this data set all the low-energy conformations of the molecules were generated to produce 6598 conformations.  Then a feature vector was extracted that describes each conformation.  This many-to-one relationship between feature vectors and molecules is called the "multiple instance problem".  When learning a classifier for this data the classifier should classify a molecule as "musk" if ANY of its conformations is classified as a musk.  A molecule should be classified as "non-musk" if NONE of its conformations is classified as a musk.

The dataset includes 300 separate boolean pseudodynamic simulations of the true rules using an asynchronous update scheme. Each of the 300 simulations begin with a randomly generated initial condition in order to ensure sampling of all of the steady states of the system.  There are a total of 43 nodes in this dataset with 5 ndoes being constants. The results for 300 separate simulations are included in the dataset.  Each simulation consists of a matrix of 0's and 1's with 21 rows and 43 columns.  The first row is the randomly generated initial condition for the particular simulation with the next 20 rows being the output from the boolean pseudodynamics simulation.  Each of the 43 columns represent the transient response of a particular node.  The nodal names are identified at the top of the data file.  A line of asterisks is used to separate the simulations from one another.  An example set of data is included below: ***************************101110111010110110110100101000101100001100111000011101111011011011111110110010111010111100011110111110101101100011010001110101010110000111011111010110110001100001111010101011000011101111101011011000110000111101010101100001110111110101101100011000011110101010110000111011111010110110001100001111010101011000011101111101011011000110000111101010101100001110111110101101100011000011110101010110000111011111010110110001100001111010101011000011101111101011011000110000111101010101100001110111110101101100011000011110101010110000111011111010110110001100001111010101011000011101111101011011000110000111101010101100001110111110101101100011000011110101010110000111011111010110110001100001111010101011000011101111101011011000110000111101010101100001110111110101101100011000011110101010110000111011111010110110001100001111010101011000011101111101011011000110000111101010101100001110111110101101100011000011110101010

Dorothea,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dorothea,2008-02-29,Life,71691,a.Original ownersThe dataset with which DOROTHEA was created is one of the KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Data Mining) Cup 2001. The original dataset and papers of the winners of the competition are available at: http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~dpage/kddcup2001/. DuPont Pharmaceuticals graciously provided this data set for the KDD Cup 2001 competition. All publications referring to analysis of this data set should acknowledge DuPont Pharmaceuticals Research Laboratories and KDD Cup 2001. b.Donor of databaseThis version of the database was prepared for the NIPS 2003 variable and feature selection benchmark by Isabelle Guyon 955 Creston Road Berkeley CA 94708 USA (isabelle '@' clopinet.com).,Drugs are typically small organic molecules that achieve their desired activity by binding to a target site on a receptor. The first step in the discovery of a new drug is usually to identify and isolate the receptor to which it should bind followed by testing many small molecules for their ability to bind to the target site. This leaves researchers with the task of determining what separates the active (binding) compounds from the inactive (non-binding) ones. Such a determination can then be used in the design of new compounds that not only bind but also have all the other properties required for a drug (solubility oral absorption lack of side effects appropriate duration of action toxicity etc.). The original data were modified for the purpose of the feature selection challenge. In particular we added a number of distractor feature called 'probes' having no predictive power. The order of the features and patterns were randomized. DOROTHEA -- Positive ex. -- Negative ex. -- Total   Training set -- 78 -- 722 -- 800   Validation set -- 34 -- 316 -- 350   Test set -- 78 -- 722 -- 800   All -- 190 -- 1760 -- 1950 We mapped Active compounds to the target value +1 (positive examples) and Inactive compounds to the target value –1 (negative examples).

Entree Chicago Recommendation Data,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Entree+Chicago+Recommendation+Data,2000-03-09,N/A,58004,Original Owner and Donor: Robin BurkeUniversity of California IrvineDepartment of Information and Computer ScienceIrvine CA 92697 Now here:http://josquin.cti.depaul.edu/~rburke/,This data records interactions with Entree Chicago restaurant recommendation system (originally [Web Link]) from September 1996 to April 1999. The data is organized into files roughly spanning a quarter year -- with Q3 1996 and Q2 1999 each only containing one month.  Each line in a session file represents a session of user interaction with the system. The (tab-separated) fields are as follows:       Date IP Entry point Rated restaurant1 ... Rated restaurantN End point 1. Entry point: Users can use a restaurant from any city as a entry point but they always get recommendations for Chicago restaurants. The entry point therefore draws from a larger universe of restaurants than the rest of the data. Entry points have the form nnnX where nnn is a numeric restaurant ID and X is a character A-H that encodes the city.       A = Atlanta     B = Boston     C = Chicago     D = Los Angeles     E = New Orleans     F = New York     G = San Francisco     H = Washington DC 2. Rated Restaurant: These are all Chicago restaurants. These entries have the form nnnX where nnn is a numeric restaurant ID and X is a character L-T that encodes the navigation operation.       L = browse (move from one restaurant in a list of recommendations to another)     M = cheaper (search for a restaurant like this one but cheaper)     N = nicer   (         "               "            but nicer)     O = closer  (unused in the production version of the system)     P = more traditional (search for a restaurant like this but serving more traditional cuisine)     Q = more creative (search for a restaurant serving more creative cuisine)     R = more lively (search for a restaurant with a livelier atmosphere)     S = quieter (search for a restaurant with a quieter atmosphere)     T = change cuisine (search for a restaurant like this but serving a different kind of food) Note that with this tweak we would ideally like to know what cuisine the user wanted to change to but this information was not recorded. 3. End point: Just the numeric id for the (Chicago) restaurant that the user saw last. In our experiments we are assuming that this was a good suggestion but it is also possible that user just gives up. Some potentially useful data is missing. In many cases we don't know the starting point because the user input a set of selection criteria (such as "inexpensive traditional Mexican") using a form submission rather than starting from a known restaurant. These queries were not recorded. This is denoted by a 0 in the entry point field. Some sessions do not have a known end point. This is marked by -1 in the end point field.   In addition to the user's interactions there is also data linking the restaurant ID with its name and features such as "fabulous wine lists" "good for younger kids" and "Ethopian" cuisine. This data is stored by city (e.g. Atlanta Boston etc.) and is in the following format:      restaurant id [tab] restaurant name [tab] restaurant features (3 digits ids separated by spaces)

Demospongiae,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Demospongiae,2010-01-21,Life,37553,Creator: Eva Armengol Enric Plaza Marta Domingo and Iosune Uriz Donor: Santiago Ontanon (santi '@' iiia.csic.es),This dataset contains 503 sponges belonging to the Demospongiae class collected from the Mediterranean (451 sponges) and Atlantic oceans (52 sponges). Each sponge is classified according to a hierarchy formed by: order family genus and specie. Each order is subdivided in several families. Each family is also divided in several genus and each genus in several species:- There are 7 different orders (between 42 to 117 sponges per order)- 42 different families (1 to 43 sponges per family)- 114 different genus (1 to 34 sponges per genus)- 230 different species (1 to 15 sponges per specie) Although classification at all these levels can be attempted it has traditionally been used as a classification dataset using 'order' as the target class. Moreover a subset consisting of 280 sponges (orders astrophoricda axinellida and hadromerida) is also commonly used. The data set is relational and is provided in two alternative formats (which are equivalent):- NOOS: NOOS is a lisp-like language to represent data as feature-terms. The following files contain the dataset in this format:- sponge-ontology.noos: this defines the ontology (sorts and features)- sponge-dm.noos: this file defines the different constants used in the examples- sponge-cases-503.noos: this file contains the actual dataset- Horn Clauses: the dataset is also provided as a set of prolog clauses equivalent to the feature-term representation in NOOS. The file sponges-503.pl contains the dataset in this format. Each predicate with head 'sponge-problem' defines a different sponge.

A Data-Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing. Decision Support Systems Elsevier 62:22-31 June 2014,The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often more than one contact to the same client was required in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. There are four datasets: 1) bank-additional-full.csv with all examples (41188) and 20 inputs ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010) very close to the data analyzed in [Moro et al. 2014]2) bank-additional.csv with 10% of the examples (4119) randomly selected from 1) and 20 inputs.3) bank-full.csv with all examples and 17 inputs ordered by date (older version of this dataset with less inputs). 4) bank.csv with 10% of the examples and 17 inputs randomly selected from 3 (older version of this dataset with less inputs). The smallest datasets are provided to test more computationally demanding machine learning algorithms (e.g. SVM). The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y).

default of credit card clients,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients,2016-01-26,Business,143748,Name: I-Cheng Yehemail addresses: (1) icyeh '@' chu.edu.tw (2) 140910 '@' mail.tku.edu.tw institutions: (1) Department of Information Management Chung Hua University Taiwan. (2) Department of Civil Engineering Tamkang University Taiwan.other contact information: 886-2-26215656 ext. 3181,This research aimed at the case of customersâ€™ default payments in Taiwan and compares the predictive accuracy of probability of default among six data mining methods. From the perspective of risk management the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. Because the real probability of default is unknown this study presented the novel â€œSorting Smoothing Methodâ€ to estimate the real probability of default. With the real probability of default as the response variable (Y) and the predictive probability of default as the independent variable (X) the simple linear regression result (Y = A + BX) shows that the forecasting model produced by artificial neural network has the highest coefficient of determination; its regression intercept (A) is close to zero and regression coefficient (B) to one. Therefore among the six data mining techniques artificial neural network is the only one that can accurately estimate the real probability of default.

Website Phishing,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Website+Phishing,2016-11-02,Computer,11955, Neda AbdelhamidAuckland Institute of Studiesnedah '@' ais.ac.nz,The phishing problem is considered a vital issue in â€œ.COMâ€ industry especially e-banking and e-commerce taking the number of online transactions involving payments. We have identified different features related to legitimate and phishy websites and collected 1353 different websites from difference sources.Phishing websites were collected from Phishtank data archive (www.phishtank.com) which is a free community site where users can submit verify track and share phishing data. The legitimate websites were collected from Yahoo and starting point directories using a web script developed in PHP. The PHP script was plugged with a browser and we collected 548 legitimate websites out of 1353 websites. There is 702 phishing URLs and 103 suspicious URLs.   When a website is considered SUSPICIOUS that means it can be either phishy or legitimate meaning the website held some legit and phishy features. 
Letter Recognition,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Letter+Recognition,1991-01-01,Computer,231377,Creator:  David J. SlateOdesta Corporation; 1890 Maple Ave; Suite 115; Evanston IL 60201 Donor:  David J. Slate (dave '@' math.nwu.edu) (708) 491-3867   ,The objective is to identify each of a large number of black-and-white rectangular pixel displays as one of the 26 capital letters in the English alphabet.  The character images were based on 20 different fonts and each letter within these 20 fonts was randomly distorted to produce a file of 20000 unique stimuli.  Each stimulus was converted into 16 primitive numerical attributes (statistical moments and edge counts) which were then scaled to fit into a range of integer values from 0 through 15.  We typically train on the first 16000 items and then use the resulting model to predict the letter category for the remaining 4000.  See the article cited above for more details.
Activity Recognition system based on Multisensor data fusion (AReM),https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Activity+Recognition+system+based+on+Multisensor+data+fusion+%28AReM%29,2016-05-18,Computer,19367,Filippo Palumbo (ab) Claudio Gallicchio (b) Rita Pucci (b) and Alessio Micheli (b) (a) Institute of Information Science and Technologies â€œAlessandro Faedoâ€ National Research Council Pisa Italy(b) Department of Computer Science University of Pisa Pisa Italy,This dataset represents a real-life benchmark in the area of Activity Recognition applications as described in [1].  The classification tasks consist in predicting the activity performed by the user from time-series generated by a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) according to the EvAAL competition technical annex ([Web Link]).  In our activity recognition system we use information coming the implicit alteration of the wireless channel due to the movements of the user. The devices measure the RSS of the beacon packets they exchange among themselves in the WSN [2]. We collect RSS data using IRIS nodes embedding a Chipcon AT86RF230 radio subsystem that implements the IEEE 802.15.4 standard and programmed with a TinyOS firmware. They are placed on the userâ€™s chest and ankles. For the purpose of communications the beacon packets are exchanged by using a simple virtual token protocol that completes its execution in a time slot of 50 milliseconds. A modified version of the Spin ([Web Link]) token-passing protocol is used to schedule node transmission in order to prevent packet collisions and maintain high data collection rate. When an anchor is transmitting all other anchors receive the packet and perform the RSS measurements. The payload of the transmitting packet is the set of RSS values between the transmitting node and the other sensors sampled during the previous cycle. From the raw data we extract time-domain features to compress the time series and slightly remove noise and correlations. We choose an epoch time of 250 milliseconds according to the EVAAL technical annex. In such a time slot we elaborate 5 samples of RSS (sampled at 20 Hz) for each of the three couples of WSN nodes (i.e. Chest-Right Ankle Chest-Left Ankle Right Ankle-Left Ankle). The features include the mean value and standard deviation for each reciprocal RSS reading from worn WSN sensors. For each activity 15 temporal sequences of input RSS data are present. The dataset contains 480 sequences for a total number of 42240 instances. We also consider two kind of bending activity illustrated in the figure provided (bendingTupe.pdf). The positions of sensor nodes with the related identifiers are shown in figure sensorsPlacement.pdf.

Ensemble members were constructed using a Latin hypercube method in LLNL's UQ Pipeline software system to sample the uncertainties of 18 model parameters within the Parallel Ocean Program (POP2) component of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM4).  Three separate Latin hypercube ensembles were conducted each containing 180 ensemble members. 46 out of the 540 simulations failed for numerical reasons at combinations of parameter values.  The goal is to use classification to predict simulation outcomes (fail or succeed) from input parameter values and to use sensitivity analysis and feature selection to determine the causes of simulation crashes.

Sensors placed on the subject's chest right wrist and left ankle are used to measure the motion experienced by diverse body parts namely acceleration rate of turn and magnetic field orientation. The sensor positioned on the chest also provides 2-lead ECG measurements which can be potentially used for basic heart monitoring checking for various arrhythmias or looking at the effects of exercise on the ECG. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------DATASET SUMMARY:#Activities: 12 #Sensor devices: 3#Subjects: 10---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- EXPERIMENTAL SETUPThe collected dataset comprises body motion and vital signs recordings for ten volunteers of diverse profile while performing 12 physical activities (Table 1). Shimmer2 [BUR10] wearable sensors were used for the recordings. The sensors were respectively placed on the subject's chest right wrist and left ankle and attached by using elastic straps (as shown in the figure in attachment). The use of multiple sensors permits us to measure the motion experienced by diverse body parts namely the acceleration the rate of turn and the magnetic field orientation thus better capturing the body dynamics. The sensor positioned on the chest also provides 2-lead ECG measurements which are not used for the development of the recognition model but rather collected for future work purposes. This information can be used for example for basic heart monitoring checking for various arrhythmias or looking at the effects of exercise on the ECG. All sensing modalities are recorded at a sampling rate of 50 Hz which is considered sufficient for capturing human activity. Each session was recorded using a video camera. This dataset is found to generalize to common activities of the daily living given the diversity of body parts involved in each one (e.g. frontal elevation of arms vs. knees bending) the intensity of the actions (e.g. cycling vs. sitting and relaxing) and their execution speed or dynamicity (e.g. running vs. standing still). The activities were collected in an out-of-lab environment with no constraints on the way these must be executed with the exception that the subject should try their best when executing them. ACTIVITY SETThe activity set is listed in the following:L1: Standing still (1 min) L2: Sitting and relaxing (1 min) L3: Lying down (1 min) L4: Walking (1 min) L5: Climbing stairs (1 min) L6: Waist bends forward (20x) L7: Frontal elevation of arms (20x)L8: Knees bending (crouching) (20x)L9: Cycling (1 min)L10: Jogging (1 min)L11: Running (1 min)L12: Jump front & back (20x)NOTE: In brackets are the number of repetitions (Nx) or the duration of the exercises (min).

Each writer contributed 52 basic characters 10 numerals and 121 assamese conjunct consonants. The total number of entries corresponding to each writer is 183 (= 52 characters + 10 numerals + 121 conjunct consonants). The total number of samples in the dataset is 8235 ( = 45 Ã— 183 ). The handwriting samples were collected on an iball 8060U external digitizing tablet connected to a laptop using its cordless digital stylus pen. The data acquisition program consists of a GUI which shows a box on the screen along with other controls. The writers are instructed to write only inside the acquisition box. The acquisition program records the handwriting as a stream of (X Y) coordinate points using the appropriate pen position sensor along with the pen-up/pen-down switching. No pressure level was recorded.  The distribution of the dataset consists of 45 folders (one for each writer) and a â€œData_Table.pdfâ€ file. This file contains information about the character id (ID) character name (Label) and actual shape of the character (Char).   Each folder contains 183 text files corresponding to the 183 characters written by a single writer. Each file is named based on the pair (M N). The text file â€œM.N.txtâ€ represents the character with ID â€œMâ€ written by the writer with ID â€œNâ€. For instance the file â€œ132.10.txtâ€ represents the character with ID â€œ132â€ written by the writer with ID â€œ10â€.

It contains measurements from 64 electrodes placed on subject's scalps which were sampled at 256 Hz (3.9-msec epoch) for 1 second.  There were two groups of subjects: alcoholic and control. Each subject was exposed to either a single stimulus (S1) or to two stimuli (S1 and S2) which were pictures of objects chosen from the 1980 Snodgrass and Vanderwart picture set. When two stimuli were shown they were presented in either a matched condition where S1 was identical to S2 or in a non-matched condition where S1 differed from S2.  Shown here are example plots of a control ([Web Link]) and alcoholic ([Web Link]) subject. The plots indicate voltage time and channel and are averaged over 10 trials for the single stimulus condition.  There were 122 subjects and each subject completed 120 trials where different stimuli were shown. The electrode positions were located at standard sites (Standard Electrode Position Nomenclature American Electroencephalographic Association 1990). Zhang et al. (1995) describes in detail the data collection process.  There are three versions of the EEG data set.  1. The Small Data SetThe small data set (smni97_eeg_data.tar.gz) contains data for the 2 subjects alcoholic a_co2a0000364 and control c_co2c0000337. For each of the 3 matching paradigms c_1 (one presentation only) c_m (match to previous presentation) and c_n (no-match to previous presentation) 10 runs are shown.  2.  The Large Data SetThe large data set (SMNI_CMI_TRAIN.tar.gz and SMNI_CMI_TEST.tar.gz) contains data for 10 alcoholic and 10 control subjects with 10 runs per subject per paradigm. The test data used the same 10 alcoholic and 10 control subjects as with the training data but with 10 out-of-sample runs per subject per paradigm.  3.

General Rodrigo Octavio JordÃ£o Ramos 1200 - Coroado I Manaus - AM 69067-005 Brasil.,This dataset was used in several classifications tasks related to the challenge of anuran species recognition through their calls. It is a multilabel dataset with three columns of labels. This dataset was created segmenting 60 audio records belonging to 4 different families 8 genus and 10 species. Each audio corresponds to one specimen (an individual frog) the record ID is also included as an extra column. We used the spectral entropy and a binary cluster method to detect audio frames belonging to each syllable. The segmentation and feature extraction were carried out in Matlab. After the segmentation we got 7195 syllables which became instances for train and test the classifier. These records were collected in situ under real noise conditions (the background sound). Some species are from the campus of Federal University of Amazonas Manaus others from Mata AtlÃ¢ntica Brazil and one of them from CÃ³rdoba Argentina.

HIGGS,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HIGGS,2014-02-12,Physical,62325,Daniel Whiteson daniel '@' uci.edu Assistant Professor Physics & Astronomy Univ. of California Irvine,The data has been produced using Monte Carlo simulations. The first 21 features (columns 2-22) are kinematic properties measured by the particle detectors in the accelerator. The last seven features are functions of the first 21 features; these are high-level features derived by physicists to help discriminate between the two classes. There is an interest in using deep learning methods to obviate the need for physicists to manually develop such features. Benchmark results using Bayesian Decision Trees from a standard physics package and 5-layer neural networks are presented in the original paper. The last 500000 examples are used as a test set.
Movie,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Movie,1999-07-07,N/A,118451, Original Owner and Donor Gio Wiederhold Stanford University 650-725-8363 gio '@' cs.stanford.edu ,The data is stored in relational form across several files. The central file (MAIN) is a list of movies each with a unique identifier. These identifiers may change in successive versions. The actors (CAST) for those movies are listed with their roles in a distinct file. More information about individual actors (ACTORS) is in a third file. All directors in MAIN are listed in a fourth file (PEOPLE) with a number of important producers writers and cinematographers. A fifth file (REMAKES) links movies that were copied to a substantial extent from each other. The sixth file (STUDIOS) provides some information about studios shown in MAIN. The original motivation was for database class exercises to replace the boring `manager of the toy-department' queries. Note that the CASTS refering MAIN and ACTORS is logically identical to the inventory file refering to suppliers and assemblies in the the standard bill-of-materials problems. Personal interests caused the database to be made complete for all Hitchcock movies and TV episodes. Related films by type and actor were added gradually. Subsequent research on temporal databases caused date fields (years only) to be added. It allows testing say if the dates-of-work of an ACTOR match the dates of the MAIN films that the CAST relation shows. Object-oriented database features could be tested with fields having multiple and two-level values as documented in DOC. The entries were gradually collected during course work starting about 1975 and are still being updated. Most of the entries were manual. The DOC file lists some of the reference works used. Corrections and additions continue to be appreciated. Detailed descriptions of the fields and their formats is provided in doc.html.  Missing Values: Outside of key fields missing values are common. Their encoding is described in DOC. Sometimes the data seems to be unavailable sometimes it hasn't been entered. Some information as `lived-with' is inherently incomplete. Censored Data: Minor actors are ignored. Dependencies: Every MAIN film must have a director in PEOPLE. About 50 pseudo director names ahve been listed in PEOPLE to allow interesting films to with (yet) unknown directors to be entered. Every CASTS entry must relate to a MAIN film entry. Every ACTOR should appear in some CASTS entry but not vice versa. See DOC for more type information. Other Relevant Information: Films are listed if known with their original language title. An Alt(T: ) field provides English translations where known. Data Format: The current files are in HTML to allow easy parsing to other formats. An XML version is being considered.

REALDISP Activity Recognition Dataset,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/REALDISP+Activity+Recognition+Dataset,2014-07-25,Computer,26064,Oresti Banos Department of Computer Architecture and Computer Technology University of Granada oresti '@' ugr.es (oresti.bl '@' gmail.com)Mate Attila Toth Signal Processing Systems TU Eindhoven A.M.Toth '@' tue.nl Oliver Amft Signal Processing Systems TU Eindhoven amft '@' tue.nl ,The REALDISP (REAListic sensor DISPlacement) dataset has been originally collected to investigate the effects of sensor displacement in the activity recognition process in real-world settings. It builds on the concept of ideal-placement self-placement and induced-displacement. The ideal and mutual-displacement conditions represent extreme displacement variants and thus could represent boundary conditions for recognition algorithms. In contrast self-placement reflects a users perception of how sensors could be attached e.g. in a sports or lifestyle application. The dataset includes a wide range of physical activities (warm up cool down and fitness exercises) sensor modalities (acceleration rate of turn magnetic field and quaternions) and participants (17 subjects). Apart from investigating sensor displacement the dataset lend itself for benchmarking activity recognition techniques in ideal conditions. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Dataset summary:#Activities: 33 #Sensors: 9#Subjects: 17#Scenarios: 3---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ACTIVITY SET:A1: Walking  A2: Jogging  A3: Running  A4: Jump up  A5: Jump front & back  A6: Jump sideways  A7: Jump leg/arms open/closed  A8: Jump rope  A9: Trunk twist (arms outstretched)  A10: Trunk twist (elbows bent)  A11: Waist bends forward  A12: Waist rotation  A13: Waist bends (reach foot with opposite hand)  A14: Reach heels backwards  A15: Lateral bend (10_ to the left + 10_ to the right)A16: Lateral bend with arm up (10_ to the left + 10_ to the right) A17: Repetitive forward stretching A18: Upper trunk and lower body opposite twist A19: Lateral elevation of arms A20: Frontal elevation of arms A21: Frontal hand claps A22: Frontal crossing of arms A23: Shoulders high-amplitude rotation A24: Shoulders low-amplitude rotation A25: Arms inner rotation A26: Knees (alternating) to the breast A27: Heels (alternating) to the backside A28: Knees bending (crouching) A29: Knees (alternating) bending forward A30: Rotation on the knees A31: Rowing A32: Elliptical bike A33: Cycling  SENSOR SETUP:Each sensor provides 3D acceleration (accXaccYaccZ) 3D gyro (gyrXgyrYgyrZ) 3D magnetic field orientation (magXmagYmagZ) and 4D quaternions (Q1Q2Q3Q4). The sensors are identified according to the body part on which is placed respectively: S1: left calf (LC)S2: left thigh (LT)S3: right calf (RC)S4: right thigh (RT)S5: back (BACK)S6: left lower arm (LLA)S7: left upper arm (LUA)S8: right lower arm (RLA)S9: right upper arm (RUA) SCENARIOS:The dataset contains information for three different scenarios depending on whether the sensors are positioned on predefined positions or placed by the users themselves.- Ideal-placement or the default scenario. The sensors are positioned by the instructor on predefined locations within each body part. The data stemming from this scenario could be considered as the â€œtraining setâ€ for supervised activity recognition systems.- Self-placement. The user is asked to position a subset of the sensors themselves on the body parts specified by the instructor but without providing any hint on how the sensors must be exactly placed. This scenario is devised to investigate some of the variability that may occur in the day-to-day usage of an activity recognition system involving wearable or self-attached sensors. Normally the self-placement will lead to on-body sensor setups that differ from the ideal-placement. Nevertheless this difference may be minimal if the subject places the sensor close to the ideal position.- Induced-displacement. An intentional mispositioning of sensors using rotations and translations with respect to the ideal placement is introduced by the instructor. One of the key interests of including this last scenario is to investigate how the performance of a certain method degrades as the system drifts far from the ideal setup. A complete and illustrated description (including table of activities sensor setup etc.) of the dataset is provided in the documentation facilitated along with the dataset. Also the papers presented in the section â€œCitation Requestsâ€ provide an insightful description of the dataset and the underlying theory.  
Mushroom,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom,1987-04-27,Life,285197,Origin: Mushroom records drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). G. H. Lincoff (Pres.) New York: Alfred A. Knopf Donor:  Jeff Schlimmer (Jeffrey.Schlimmer '@' a.gp.cs.cmu.edu),This data set includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family (pp. 500-525).  Each species is identified as definitely edible definitely poisonous or of unknown edibility and not recommended.  This latter class was combined with the poisonous one.  The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like ``leaflets three let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.
Wall-Following Robot Navigation Data,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wall-Following+Robot+Navigation+Data,2010-08-04,Computer,40730,(a) Creators: Ananda Freire Marcus Veloso and Guilherme Barreto Department of Teleinformatics Engineering Federal University of CearÃ¡Fortaleza CearÃ¡ Brazil   (b) Donors of database: Ananda Freire (anandalf '@' gmail.com)Guilherme Barreto (guilherme '@' deti.ufc.br),The provided files comprise three different data sets. The first one contains the raw values of the measurements of all 24 ultrasound sensors and the corresponding class label (see Section 7). Sensor readings are sampled at a rate of 9 samples per second. The second one contains four sensor readings named 'simplified distances' and the corresponding class label (see Section 7). These simplified distances are referred to as the 'front distance' 'left distance' 'right distance' and 'back distance'. They consist respectively of the minimum sensor readings among those within 60 degree arcs located at the front left right and back parts of the robot. The third one contains only the front and left simplified distances and the corresponding class label. It is worth mentioning that the 24 ultrasound readings and the simplified distances were collected at the same time step so each file has the same number of rows (one for each sampling time step). The wall-following task and data gathering were designed to test the hypothesis that this apparently simple navigation task is indeed a non-linearly separable classification task. Thus linear classifiers such as the Perceptron network are not able to learn the task and command the robot around the room without collisions. Nonlinear neural classifiers such as the MLP network are able to learn the task and command the robot successfully without collisions.  If some kind of short-term memory mechanism is provided to the neural classifiers their performances are improved in general. For example if past inputs are provided together with current sensor readings even the Perceptron becomes able to learn the task and command the robot succesfully. If a recurrent neural network such as the Elman network is used to learn the task the resulting dynamical classifier is able to learn the task using less hidden neurons than the MLP network. Files with different number of sensor readings were built in order to evaluate the performance of the classifiers with respect to the number of inputs.
Volcanoes on Venus - JARtool experiment,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Volcanoes+on+Venus+-+JARtool+experiment,N/A,Physical,31399,Michael C. BurlMS 126-347 JPL4800 Oak Grove DrivePasadena CA 91109(818) 393-5345Michael.C.Burl '@' jpl.nasa.gov http://www-aig.jpl.nasa.gov/mls/home/burl/,The data was collected by the Magellan spacecraft over an approximately four year period from 1990--1994. The objective of the mission was to obtain global mapping of the surface of Venus using synthetic aperture radar (SAR). A more detailed discussion of the mission and objectives is available at  JPL's Magellan webpage. There are some spatial dependencies. For example background patches from with in a single image are likely to be more similar than background patches taken across different images. In addition to the images there are "ground truth" files that specify the locations of volcanoes within the images. The quotes around "ground truth" are intended as a reminder that there is no absolute ground truth for this data set. No one has been to Venus and the image quality does not permit 100% unambiguous identification of the volcanoes even by human experts. There are labels that provide some measure of subjective uncertainty (1 = definitely a volcano 2 = probably 3 = possibly 4 = only a pit is visible). See reference [Smyth95] for more information on the labeling uncertainty problem. There are also files that specify the exact set of experiments using in the published evaluations of the JARtool system.  The image files are in a format called VIEW. This format consists of two files a binary file with extension .sdt (the image data) and an ascii file with extension .spr (header information). There is a MATLAB utility function included in the data package that can be used to read the data. If you want to use something other than Matlab you are on your own but the format is fairly simple and can be understood by looking at the Matlab code. The labeling files are provided in two forms. The .lxyr files are simple space-separated ascii containing label x-location of center y-location of center and radius.

PazzaniDepartment of Information and Computer ScienceUniversity of California Irvine California 92697 USAeamonn '@' ics.uci.edu pazzani '@' ics.uci.edu ,This data set is designed for testing indexing schemes in time series databases. It is a much larger dataset than has been used in any published study (That we are currently aware of). It contains one million data points. The data has been split into 10 sections to facilitate testing (see below). We recommend building the index with 9 of the 100000-datapoint sections and randomly extracting a query shape from the 10th section. (Some previously published work seems to have used queries that were also used to build the indexing structure. This will produce optimistic results) The data are interesting because they have structure at different resolutions. Each of the 10 sections where generated by independent invocations of the function: (see equation.gif) Where rand(x) produces a random integer between zero and x. The data appears highly periodic but never exactly repeats itself. This feature is designed to challenge the indexing structure. The time series are ploted here: (ts1-5.gif) (ts6-10.gif)

Gas sensor array under dynamic gas mixtures,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gas+sensor+array+under+dynamic+gas+mixtures,2015-03-20,Computer,27718,Creators: Jordi Fonollosa (fonollosa '@'ucsd.edu) BioCircutis Institute University of California San Diego San Diego California USA  Donors of the Dataset:Jordi Fonollosa (fonollosa '@'ucsd.edu) Ramon Huerta (rhuerta '@' ucsd.edu),This data set contains the acquired time series from 16 chemical sensors exposed to gas mixtures at varying concentration levels. In particular we generated two gas mixtures: Ethylene and Methane in air and Ethylene and CO in air. Each measurement was constructed by the continuous acquisition of the 16-sensor array signals for a duration of about 12 hours without interruption.  The data set was collected in a gas delivery platform facility at the ChemoSignals Laboratory in the BioCircuits Institute University of California San Diego. The measurement system platform provides versatility for obtaining the desired concentrations of the chemical substances of interest with high accuracy and in a highly reproducible manner.  The sensor array included 16 chemical sensors (Figaro Inc. US) of 4 different types: TGS-2600 TGS-2602 TGS-2610 TGS-2620 (4 units of each type). The sensors were integrated with customized signal conditioning and control electronics. The operating voltage of the sensors which controls the sensorsâ€™ operating temperature was kept constant at 5 V for the whole duration of the experiments. The sensorsâ€™ conductivities were acquired continuously at a sampling frequency of 100 Hz. The sensor array was placed in a 60 ml measurement chamber where the gas sample was injected at a constant flow of 300 ml/min. Each measurement was constructed by the continuous acquisition of the 16-sensor array signals while concentration levels changed randomly. For each measurement (each gas mixture) the signals were acquired continuously for about 12 hours without interruption.  The concentration transitions were set at random times (in the interval 80-120s) and to random concentration levels. The data set was constructed such that all possible transitions are present: increasing decreasing or setting to zero the concentration of one volatile while the concentration of the other volatile is kept constant (either at a fixed or at zero concentration level). At the beginning ending and approximately every 10000 s we inserted additional predefined concentration patterns with pure gas mixtures. The concentration ranges for Ethylene Methane and CO were selected such that the induced magnitudes of the sensor responses were similar. Moreover for gas mixtures lower concentration levels were favored. Therefore the multivariate response of the sensors to the presented set of stimuli is challenging since none of the configurations (singlegas or mixture presentation) can be easily identified from the magnitude of sensorsâ€™ responses. In particular Ethylene concentration ranges from 0-20 ppm; 0-600 ppm for CO; and 0-300 ppm for Methane. The primary purpose of making this data set freely accessible on-line is to provide extensive and continuous time series acquired from chemical sensors to the sensor and artificial intelligence research communities to develop and test strategies to solve a wide variety of tasks. In particular the data set may be useful to develop algorithms for continuous monitoring or improve response time of sensory systems. Also the repetition of the same type of sensors in the array will allow further investigation on sensor variability (reproducibility of sensors of the same kind). Other interesting topics may include sensor failure (to what extent system predictions degrade when sensors start failing) or calibration transfer (whether the model for one sensor can be extended to other sensors). More information on the generated data set can be found in Fonollosa et al. 'Reservoir Computing compensates slow response of chemosensor arrays exposed to fast varying gas concentrations in continuous monitoring'; Sensors and Actuators B 2015.  The data set can be used exclusively for research purposes. Commercial purposes are fully excluded.

There are 38 control mice and 34 trisomic mice (Down syndrome) for a total of 72 mice. In the experiments 15 measurements were registered of each protein per sample/mouse. Therefore for control mice there are 38x15 or 570 measurements and for trisomic mice there are 34x15 or 510 measurements. The dataset contains a total of 1080 measurements per protein. Each measurement can be considered as an independent sample/mouse. The eight classes of mice are described based on features such as genotype behavior and treatment. According to genotype mice can be control or trisomic. According to behavior some mice have been stimulated to learn (context-shock) and others have not (shock-context) and in order to assess the effect of the drug memantine in recovering the ability to learn in trisomic mice some mice have been injected with the drug and others have not. Classes:c-CS-s: control mice stimulated to learn injected with saline (9 mice)c-CS-m: control mice stimulated to learn injected with memantine (10 mice)c-SC-s: control mice not stimulated to learn injected with saline (9 mice)c-SC-m: control mice not stimulated to learn injected with memantine (10 mice) t-CS-s: trisomy mice stimulated to learn injected with saline (7 mice)t-CS-m: trisomy mice stimulated to learn injected with memantine (9 mice)t-SC-s: trisomy mice not stimulated to learn injected with saline (9 mice)t-SC-m: trisomy mice not stimulated to learn injected with memantine (9 mice) The aim is to identify subsets of proteins that are discriminant between the classes.

Protocol:   Three male and one female subjects (age 25 to 30) who have experienced aggression in scenarios   such as physical fighting took part in the experiment. Throughout 20 individual experiments   each subject had to perform ten normal and ten aggressive activities. Regarding the rights of the   subjects involved ethical regulations and safety precaution have been followed based on the code   of ethics of the British psychological society. The regulations explain the ethical legislations   to be applied when experiments with human subjects are conducted. According to the experimental   setup and the precautions taken the ultimate risk of injuries was minimal. The subjects were aware   that since their involvement in this series of experiments was voluntary it was made clear that   they could withdraw at any time from the study. 2. Instrumentation:   The Essex robotic arena was the main experimental hall where the data collection took place.   With area 4x5.5m the subjects expressed aggressive physical activities at random locations. A   professional kick-boxing standing bag has been used 1.75m tall with a human figure drawn on   its body. The subjectsâ€™ performance has been recorded by the Delsys EMG apparatus interfacing   human activity with myoelectrical contractions. Based on this context the data acquisition process   involved eight skin-surface electrodes placed on the upper arms (biceps and triceps) and upper legs   (thighs and hamstrings). 3. Data Setup:   The overall number of electrodes is 8 which corresponds to 8 input time series one for a muscle   channel (ch1-8). Each time series contains ~10000 samples (~15 actions per experimental session   for each subject).

Then several Data Mining methods were applied. After fitting the models the outputs were   post-processed with the inverse of the ln(x+1) transform. Four different input setups were   used. The experiments were conducted using a 10-fold (cross-validation) x 30 runs. Two   regression metrics were measured: MAD and RMSE. A Gaussian support vector machine (SVM) fed   with only 4 direct weather conditions (temp RH wind and rain) obtained the best MAD value:   12.71 +- 0.01 (mean and confidence interval within 95% using a t-student distribution). The   best RMSE was attained by the naive mean predictor. An analysis to the regression error curve   (REC) shows that the SVM model predicts more examples within a lower admitted error. In effect   the SVM model predicts better small fires which are the majority.

Each species was represented by 11 to 60 mass spectra obtained from 7 to 20 bacterial strains constituting altogether a dataset of 571 spectra obtained from 213 strains. The spectra were obtained according to the standard culture-based workflow used in clinical routine in which the microorganism was first grown on an agar plate for 24 to 48 hours before a portion of colony was picked spotted on a MALDI slide and a mass spectrum was acquired. B) Based on this reference panel a dedicated in vitro mock-up mixture dataset was constituted. For that purpose we considered 10 pairs of species of various taxonomic proximity:   * 4 mixtures labelled A B C and D involved species that belong to the same genus   * 2 mixtures labelled E and F involved species that belong to distinct genera but to the same Gram type   * 4 mixtures labelled G H I and J involved species that belong to distinct Gram types.Each mixture was represented by 2 pairs of strains which were mixed according to the following 9 concentration ratios : 1:0 10:1 5:1 2:1 1:1 1:2 1:5 1:10 0:1. Two replicate spectra were acquired for each concentration ratio and each couple of strains leading altogether to a dataset of 360 spectra among which 80 are actually pure sample spectra.

It will be the example of diagnosing of the acute inflammations of urinary bladder and acute nephritises. For better understanding of the problem let us consider definitions of both diseases given by medics. Acute inflammation of urinary bladder is characterised by sudden occurrence of pains in the abdomen region and the urination in form of constant urine pushing micturition pains and sometimes lack of urine keeping. Temperature of the body is rising however most often not above 38C. The excreted urine is turbid and sometimes bloody. At proper treatment symptoms decay usually within several days. However there is inclination to returns. At persons with acute inflammation of urinary bladder we should expect that the illness will turn into protracted form. Acute nephritis of renal pelvis origin occurs considerably more often at women than at men. It begins with sudden fever which reaches and sometimes exceeds 40C. The fever is accompanied by shivers and one- or both-side lumbar pains which are sometimes very strong. Symptoms of acute inflammation of urinary bladder appear very often. Quite not infrequently there are nausea and vomiting and spread pains of whole abdomen. The data was created by a medical expert as a data set to test the expert system which will perform the presumptive diagnosis of two diseases of urinary system.  The basis for rules detection was Rough Sets Theory.  Each instance represents an potential patient. The data is in an ASCII file. Attributes are separated by TAB.Each line of the data file starts with a digit which tells the temperature of patient.   -- Attribute lines:       For example '359nonoyesyesyesyesno'       Where: '359'Temperature of patient  'no'Occurrence of nausea  'no'Lumbar pain   'yes'Urine pushing (continuous need for urination)   'yes'Micturition pains   'yes'Burning of urethra itch swelling of urethra outlet  'yes'decision: Inflammation of urinary bladder   'no'decision: Nephritis of renal pelvis origin

Quadruped Mammals,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Quadruped+Mammals,1992-08-25,Life,43197,Origin: Gennari J.~H. Langley P \& Fisher D. (1989). Models of incremental concept formation. {\it Artificial Intelligence\/} {\it 40\/} 11--61. Donor:  John H. Gennari (gennari '@' camis.stanford.edu 8/1992),The file animals.c is a data generator of structured instances representing quadruped animals as used by Gennari Langley and Fisher (1989) to evaluate the CLASSIT unsupervised learning algorithm. Instances have 8 components: neck four legs torso head and tail.  Each component is represented as a simplified/generalized cylinder (i.e. inspired by David Marr's work in "Vision: A Computational Investigation Into the Human Representation  and Processing of Visual Information" published by Freeman in 1982). Each cylinder is itself described by 9 attributes: location x 3 axis x 3 height radius and texture.  This code generates instances in one of four classes: dogs cats horses and giraffes.  The program generates instances by selecting a class according to a distribution determined by function rand4().  Each class has a prototype; the prototype of the selected class is perturbed according to a distribution described in the code for the four classes (i.e. parameterized means with Guassian distributions are used to represent prototypes and perturbation distributions where the means are used to distinguish the four classes). From John Gennari: (1990) The only notes I have about it is that I don't use the data format it creates any more. To change this modify "printpart()". Also it uses a very rough approximation for a bell-shaped distribution. Currently I use a much more sophisticated random number generator. To fix this just replace "bellrand()" with a real bell shaped distribution.
Record Linkage Comparison Patterns,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Record+Linkage+Comparison+Patterns,2011-03-10,N/A,52571,The underlying records stem from the epidemiological cancer registry of theGerman state of North Rhine-Westphalia (Epidemiologisches Krebsregister NRWhttp://www.krebsregister.nrw.de). Creation of comparison patterns andassignment of matching status were undertaken by staff members ofthe Institute for Medical Biostatistics Epidemiology and Informatics (IMBEI)at the University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz Germany (http://www.imbei.uni-mainz.de).,The records represent individual data including first and family name sex date of birth and postal code which were collected through iterative insertions in the course of several years. The comparison patterns in this data set are based on a sample of 100.000 records dating from 2005 to 2008. Data pairs were classified as 'match' or 'non-match' during an extensive manual review where several documentarists were involved. The resulting classification formed the basis for assessing the quality of the registryâ€™s own record linkage procedure. In order to limit the amount of patterns a blocking procedure was appliedwhich selects only record pairs that meet specific agreement conditions. Theresults of the following six blocking iterations were merged together:   1. Phonetic equality of first name and family name equality of date of birth.  2. Phonetic equality of first name equality of day of birth.  3. Phonetic equality of first name equality of month of birth.  4. Phonetic equality of first name equality of year of birth.  5. Equality of complete date of birth.  6. Phonetic equality of family name equality of sex. This procedure resulted in 5.749.132 record pairs of which 20.931 are matches. The data set is split into 10 blocks of (approximately) equal size and ratioof matches to non-matches. The separate file frequencies.csv contains for every predictive attribute the average number of values in the underlying records. These values can for examplebe used as u-probabilities in weight-based record linkage following theframework of Fellegi and Sunter.

Greenhouse Gas Observing Network,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Greenhouse+Gas+Observing+Network,2015-04-16,Physical,25116,D. Lucas (ddlucas .at. alum.mit.edu) Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. This data was created under work funded by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and Laboratory Directed Research and Development projects at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The work was performed under the auspices of the US Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344 and is released under UCRL number LLNL-MISC-668913. ,This data set contains time series of greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations at 2921 grid cells in California created using simulations of the Weather Research and Forecast model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). Each grid cell covers an area of 12 km by 12 km and there is one data file per grid cell. Each file contains 16 time series of GHG concentrations. The data points in the time series are spaced 6 hours apart (4 samples per day) over the period May 10 â€“ July 31 2010. The first 15 rows are time series of GHG tracers released from 14 distinct spatial regions in California and one outside of California. The last row corresponds to the time series of â€œsynthetic GHG observationsâ€ generated with EDGAR emissions of HFC-134a scaled by a factor 0.7 and with noise added. Using this data the goals are to (1) use inverse methods to determine the optimal values of the weights in the weighted sum of 15 tracers that best matches the synthetic observations (2) and use optimization methods to determine the best locations to observe GHGs to constrain the inversion. We used a Bayesian method for (1) and genetic algorithms for (2).  Further details about the data and methods are given in the publication 'Designing optimal greenhouse gas observing networks that consider performance and cost' Geoscientific Instrumentation Methods and Data Systems.

Through these systems user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic environmental and health issues.  Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway the duration of travel departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence it is expected that most of important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.

Rodríguez Eva Salvador Balaguer Ana Sanchís Carlos Serra and Sergi Trilles.,Many real world applications need to know the localization of a user in the world to provide their services. Therefore automatic user localization has been a hot research topic in the last years. Automatic user localization consists of estimating the position of the user (latitude longitude and altitude) by using an electronic device usually a mobile phone. Outdoor localization problem can be solved very accurately thanks to the inclusion of GPS sensors into the mobile devices. However indoor localization is still an open problem mainly due to the loss of GPS signal in indoor environments. Although there are some indoor positioning technologies and methodologies this database is focused on WLAN fingerprint-based ones (also know as WiFi Fingerprinting). Although there are many papers in the literature trying to solve the indoor localization problem using a WLAN fingerprint-based method there still exists one important drawback in this field which is the lack of a common database for comparison purposes. So UJIIndoorLoc database is presented to overcome this gap. We expect that the proposed database will become the reference database to compare different indoor localization methodologies based on WiFi fingerprinting. The UJIIndoorLoc database covers three buildings of Universitat Jaume I with 4 or more floors and almost 110.000m2. It can be used for classification e.g. actual building and floor identification or regression e.g. actual longitude and latitude estimation. It was created in 2013 by means of more than 20 different users and 25 Android devices. The database consists of 19937 training/reference records (trainingData.csv file) and 1111 validation/test records (validationData.csv file). The 529 attributes contain the WiFi fingerprint the coordinates where it was taken and other useful information. Each WiFi fingerprint can be characterized by the detected Wireless Access Points (WAPs) and the corresponding Received Signal Strength Intensity (RSSI). The intensity values are represented as negative integer values ranging -104dBm (extremely poor signal) to 0dbM. The positive value 100 is used to denote when a WAP was not detected. During the database creation 520 different WAPs were detected. Thus the WiFi fingerprint is composed by 520 intensity values. Then the coordinates (latitude longitude floor) and Building ID are provided as the attributes to be predicted.  Additional information has been provided. The particular space (offices labs etc.) and the relative position (inside/outside the space) where the capture was taken have been recorded. Outside means that the capture was taken in front of the door of the space. Information about who (user) how (android device & version) and when (timestamp) WiFi capture was taken is also recorded.

The different blocks forming the complete simulator (Propeller Hull GT Gear Box and Controller) have been developed and fine tuned over the year on several similar real propulsion plants. In view of these observations the available data are in agreement with a possible real vessel.In this release of the simulator it is also possible to take into account the performance decay over time of the GT components such as GT compressor and turbines.The propulsion system behaviour has been described with this parameters:- Ship speed (linear function of the lever position lp).- Compressor degradation coefficient kMc.- Turbine degradation coefficient kMt.so that each possible degradation state can be described by a combination of this triple (lpkMtkMc).The range of decay of compressor and turbine has been sampled with an uniform grid of precision 0.001 so to have a good granularity of representation.In particular for the compressor decay state discretization the kMc coefficient has been investigated in the domain [1; 0.95] and the turbine coefficient in the domain [1; 0.975].Ship speed has been investigated sampling the range of feasible speed from 3 knots to 27 knots with a granularity of representation equal to tree knots.A series of measures (16 features) which indirectly represents of the state of the system subject to performance decay has been acquired and stored in the dataset over the parameter's space.Check the README.txt file for further details about this dataset.

The measurements cover the period from Jan. 1st 2008 to Mar. 30th 2009 and are sampled every 10 minutes. We consider each day in this database as a single time series of dimension 963 (the number of sensors which functioned consistently throughout the studied period) and length 6 x 24=144. We remove public holidays from the dataset as wellas two days with anomalies (March 8th 2009 and March 9th 2008) where all sensors were muted between 2:00 and 3:00 AM. This results in a database of 440 time series. The task we propose on this dataset is to classify each observed day as the correct day of the week from Monday to Sunday e.g. label it with an integer in {1234567}.  I will keep separate copies of this database on my website in a Matlab format. If you use Matlab it might be more convenient to consider these .mat files directly. Data-Format------------- There are two files for each fold the data file and the labels file. We have split the 440 time series between train and test folds but you are of course free to merge them to consider a different cross validation setting.- The PEMS_train textfile has 263 lines. Each line describes a time-series provided as a matrix. The matrix syntax is that of Matlab e.g. [ a b ; c d] is the matrix with row vectors [a b] and [c d] in that order. Each matrix describes the different occupancies rates (963 lines one for each station/detector) sampled every 10 minutes during the day (144 columns).- The PEMS_trainlabel text describes for each day of measurements described above the day of the week on which the data was sampled namely an integer between 1 (Mon.) and 7 (Sun.). - PEMS_test and PEMS_testlabels are formatted in the same way except that there are 173 test instances. - The permutation that I used to shuffle the dataset is given in the randperm file. If you need to rearrange the data so that it follows the calendar order you should merge train and test samples and reorder them using the inverse permutation of randperm.

Prehistoric men created the desired shape of a stone toolby striking on a raw stone thus splitting off flakes the wasteproducts of the crafting process. Archaelogists do not find many toolsbut they do find flakes. The data set is about these flakes. Its rows donot stand for single flakes but for whole inventories of them. The givenfeatures are relative frequencies of binary and mean values of numericalcharacteristics taken over all pieces found in the inventory. A questionrelated to the data set is: Does the data reflect the technologicalprogress during several hundred thousand years?

3D Road Network (North Jutland Denmark),https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/3D+Road+Network+%28North+Jutland%2C+Denmark%29,2013-04-16,Computer,121258,Manohar Kaul Department of Computer Science Aarhus University Denmark (mkaul '@' cs.au.dk) ,This dataset was constructed by adding elevation information to a 2D road network in North Jutland Denmark (covering a region of 185 x 135 km^2). Elevation values where extracted from a publicly available massive Laser Scan Point Cloud for Denmark (available at : [Web Link] (Bottom-most dataset)). This 3D road network was eventually used for benchmarking various fuel and CO2 estimation algorithms. This dataset can be used by any applications that require to know veryaccurate elevation information of a road network to perform more accurate routing for eco-routing cyclist routes etc. For the data mining and machine learning community this dataset can be used as 'ground-truth' validation in spatial mining techniques and satellite image processing. It has no class labels but can be used in unsupervised learning and regression to guess some missing elevation information for some points on the road. The work was supported by the Reduction project that is funded by the European Comission as FP7-ICT-2011-7 STREP project number 288254.
Wine Quality,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality,2009-10-07,Business,520496,Paulo Cortez University of Minho GuimarÃ£es Portugal http://www3.dsi.uminho.pt/pcortez A. Cerdeira F. Almeida T. Matos and J. Reis Viticulture Commission of the Vinho Verde Region(CVRVV) Porto Portugal @2009,The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details consult: [Web Link] or the reference [Cortez et al. 2009].  Due to privacy and logistic issues only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types wine brand wine selling price etc.). These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks.  The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are munch more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. Also we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods.
Planning Relax,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Planning+Relax,2012-07-17,Computer,37312,Rajen Bhatt rajen.bhatt '@' gmail.com IIT Delhi,EEG record contains many regular oscillations which are believed to reflect synchronized rhythmic activity in a group of neurons. Most activity related EEG patterns occur within the following frequency bands. Delta (0.5 â€“ 4 Hz.) Theta (4 â€“ 8 Hz) Alpha (8 â€“ 13 Hz) Beta (13 â€“ 22 Hz) and Gamma (30 â€“ 40 Hz). The waves with the frequency of  7 â€“ 13 Hz over motor processing areas are called mu rhythm and reflect idling activity in motor areas. It is more pronounced when the subjects are at rest and at least a second before subjects initiate voluntary movement the mu  activity over the hemisphere contralateral to the region moved shows a decrease in amplitude and is called Event Related Desynchronization (ERD).For the current study EEG data was collected for 5 times on various days from a healthy right-handed subject of 25 years of age. The data was recorded on a Medelec Profile Digital EEG machine. The settings of high frequency filter 50 Hz low frequency filter 1.6 Hz notch filter 50 Hz sensitivity 70 micro volts/mm and a sampling rate of 256 Hz were used for the basic signal processing. Eight EEG electrodes (C3 C4 P3 P4 F3 F4 T3 and T4) were placed according to the international standard 10-20 system of electrode placement. Bipolar and unipolar EEG was recorded from eight Ag/AgCI scalp electrodes which were placed 2.5 cm anterior and posterior to the central electrodes C3 and C4 (left and right side of the hemisphere). A1 and A2 are reference electrodes. The reference electrodes are placed on the left and right ears and the ground electrode on the forehead. EOG (Electrooculogram) being a noise artifact was derived from two electrodes placed on the outer cantus of left and right eye in order to detect eye movement. These EOG signals are then used to eliminate eye movement artifacts. The subject was asked to lie down comfortably in a relaxed position with eyes closed and advised to minimize eye movements. The EEG was recorded for the relaxed state for 5 minutes. Following this an audio beep of 60 db and 0.91 sec. duration was given at the start and end of a 5 second epoch where the subject was asked to mentally plan lifting of the right hand thumb. This activity is collected as a 5 second epoch data corresponding to â€˜movement imageryâ€™ state. After a gap of 5 minutes the same cue is given to repeat the experiment. The whole experiment lasts for approximately 30 minutes collecting data for 5 trials of 5 second epoch each for normal relaxed state and 5 trials of 5 second epoch each for movement imagery. No actual movement is performed during the session. All data sets were visually checked for artifacts before final selection.
Gas sensors for home activity monitoring,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gas+sensors+for+home+activity+monitoring,2016-07-15,Computer,38893,Creators:Flavia HuertaRamon Huerta University of California San Diego USA Donors:Flavia HuertaRamon Huerta University of California San Diego USA (rhuerta â€˜@â€™ ucsd.edu)Thiago Mosqueiro University of California San Diego USA (thmosqueiro â€˜@â€™ ucsd.edu)Jordi Fonollosa Institute for Bioengineering of Catalunya Spain (jfonollosa â€˜@â€™ ibecbarcelona.eu)Nikolai Rulkov University of California San Diego USA ( nrulkov â€˜@â€™ ucsd.edu )Irene Rodriguez-Lujan Universidad Autonoma de Madrid Spain ( Irene.rodriguez â€˜@â€™ uam.es ),This dataset has recordings of a gas sensor array composed of 8 MOX gas sensors and a temperature and humidity sensor. This sensor array was exposed to background home activity while subject to two different stimuli: wine and banana. The responses to banana and wine stimuli were recorded by placing the stimulus close to the sensors. The duration of each stimulation varied from 7min to 2h with an average duration of 42min. This dataset contains a set of time series from three different conditions: wine banana and background activity. There are 36 inductions with wine 33 with banana and 31 recordings of background activity. One possible application is to discriminate among background wine and banana. This dataset is composed of two files: HT_sensor_dataset.dat (zipped) where the actual time series are stored and the HT_Sensor_metadata.dat where metadata for each induction is stored. Each induction is uniquely identified by an id in both files. Thus metadata for a particular induction can be easily found by matching columns id from each file.  We also made available python scripts to exemplify how to import organize and plot our data. The scripts are available on GitHub:[Web Link]  For each induction we include one hour of background activity prior to and after the stimulus presentation. Time series were recorded at one sample per second with minor variations at some data points due to issues in the wireless communication. For details on which sensors were used and how the time series is organized see Attribute Information below. The metadata stored in file HT_Sensor_metadata.dat is divided in the following columns: * id: identification of the induction to be matched with id in file HT_Sensor_dataset.dat;* date: day month and year when this induction was recorded;* class: what was used to generate this induction (wine banana or background);* t0: time in hours in which the induction started (represents the time zero in file HT_Sensor_dataset.dat);* dt: interval that this induction lasted.

Automobile,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Automobile,1987-05-19,N/A,237169,Creator/Donor:  Jeffrey C.

The second rating corresponds to the degree to which the auto is more risky than its price indicates. Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its price.   Then if it is more risky (or less) this symbol is adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale.  Actuarians call this process "symboling".  A value of +3 indicates that the auto is risky -3 that it is probably pretty safe. The third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured vehicle year.  This value is normalized for all autos within a particular size classification (two-door small station wagons sports/speciality etc...) and represents the average loss per car per year. Note: Several of the attributes in the database could be used as a "class" attribute.

Pioneer-1 Mobile Robot Data,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pioneer-1+Mobile+Robot+Data,1999-01-28,Computer,26361,Matthew D. Schmill Paul R. CohenExperimental Knowledge Systems Laboratory Department of Computer Science Box 34610 University of Massachusetts Amherst Amherst MA 01003-4610 schmill '@' cs.umass.edu cohen '@' cs.umass.edu,The data were collected over a series of specifically designed trials. Our hope was to cover most of the types of sensory interactions that a Pioneer might be reasonably expected to encounter: things like passing by visible objects pushing visible objects crashing into walls etc. Many of these interactions are repeated throughout the dataset. This data was collected to serve as the basis for work in learning and conceptual development. Our first goal was to be able to have the robot cluster these experiences by their dynamics on their own into clusters of experiences with a common outcome. Each data file contains time series data in which each row of data corresponds to a single observation of the sensor array. Included in each row are two additional variables 'id' and 'description' which indicate the experience number that the observation belongs to and a description of that experience respectively. Observations within an experience are taken every 100ms.  The data is stored in three text files: one file for experiences in which the Pioneer was moving in a straight line one in which it was turning in place and one in which it was raising or lowering its gripper. The description variable is a string of symbols. The string breaks down as follows: "u" or "o" -  unobstructed or obstructed"x.xs"     -  activity lasted x.x secondsactivity   -  the activity and speed if applicable i.e. move100 = move forward at 100mm/secvisual     -  objects in the visual array are listed in sequence. "cAHEAD" indicates an object visible to channel c directly AHEAD of the Pioneer.[visual.X] -  visual descriptions followed by a '.' and one character indicate that something special happens with the visible object. .V means the object Vanishes from sight during the activity. .D indicates that the object is Discovered (becomes visible) during the activity. .P indicates that the object is pushed.  An example: "u-3.5s-retr-100-aRIGHT.D"  An unobstructed retreat (move) at -100 mm/sec for 3.5 seconds with an object being discovered in channel A. It should be noted that particularly with respect to the visual channels the description may not be 100% accurate. Since the visual channels respond to colors that they are trained on (visual a=red visual b=yellow visual c=blue) it was possible but infrequent for some extraneous object in the environment generated a response in visual channels that were not supposed to show activity in a particular trial. Rows are seperated by carriage returns columns by commas.

The tested gas classes (12 in total) formed a relatively broad combination of two analytes acetone and ethanol in binary mixtures. Both raw data set and feature data set are available. In particular two sets of low-frequency and high-frequency features are provided for a comparison study. The primary data analysis is supposed to be a multivariate regression with multiple responses (two responses) where the predictors were the features extracted from the sensor signals and the responses were the concentrations of two analytes acetone and ethanol. This task is also known as a mixture quantification problem of two analytes. Please see the article (Ziyatdinov et al. 2014 Section 3.2) for such regression analysis based on partial least squares (PLS). A classification task is also possible given that a small number of samples per class is available if all the 12 classes are used. Another classification problem can be stated to distinguish two pure analytes and mixtures of them. Three concentrations doses 0.1 0.3 and 1 vol.% were used to prepare the dilutions in water for the pure analytes. The same dilutions were used to generate gas mixtures. The gas classes included samples of pure ethanol ('lab' attribute eth-0.1 eth-0.3 and eth-1) samples of pure acetone (ace-0.1 ace-0.3 and ace-1) samples of binary mixtures of ethanol and acetone (ace-0.1-eth-0.1 ace-0.1-eth-0.3 ace-0.3-eth-0.1 ace-0.1-eth-1 and ace-1-eth-0.1) and samples of water dilutions without any analyte (air) giving a total number of 12 classes. The choice of these analytes and concentrations was not affected by any particular application constraint except that the sensors of selected models show consistent and diverse responses among the gas classes. The statistics on class distribution among 58 samples: eth-0.1: 6eth-0.3: 4eth-1: 5ace-0.1: 6ace-0.3: 6ace-1: 3ace-0.1-eth-0.1: 4ace-0.1-eth-0.3: 5ace-0.3-eth-0.1: 5ace-0.1-eth-1: 3ace-1-eth-0.1: 3air: 8 The measurements were split into 5 batches ('batch' attribute) where each batch contained records approximately for all gas classes given in a random order. All the batches were collected in a time period of 4 days to minimize the effect of the long-term internal and environmental noise in the system. The statistics on batch distribution among 58 samples: day-1-morning: 19day-2-afternoon: 10day-2-morning: 10day-3-morning: 11day-4-afternoon: 8 The array was composed of 16 metal-oxide gas sensors of 5 different TGS models from Figaro Inc. The sensors were configured for 10 different sensor conditioning profiles based on the combination of 5 TGS models and 2 sensor operating temperatures. The circuit board with the gas sensor array was placed in a 70 ml inner volume chamber connected to the mechanical ventilator. The device of the mechanical ventilator was made commercially available from Harvard Apparatus (Harvard Apparatus Harvard Inspira Advanced Safety Ventilator Manual Tech. rep. 2003). The mechanical ventilator includes a cylinder of volume 63.44 cm3 and a mechanical pump that takes air from the outlet 'Source' and pushes the air sample through the outlet 'To Animal'. The system also receives the sample again in the outlet 'From Animal' to close the loop control the air pressure decay and collect the exhaled air. The cylinder of the ventilator was fixed to a frequency of 5 breaths per minute approximately equivalent to 0.08 Hz for all the measurements. See the article (Ziyatdinov et al. 2014 Section 2.1) for a detailed description of the experimental set up. The measurement protocol was the following: using a micropipette we delivered 10 Î¼l of the corresponding dilution to the vessel which in turn was connected to the apparatus 'Source' channel to expose the sensor array to the generated gas sample. After 3 min of exposition the source of the gas vapour was removed from the vessel to start the recovery phase. During the recovery phase the system was sampling room air for 2 additional minutes to record the decay in the sensors signals. The recorded time-series signal for each sensor was acquired at the sampling frequency of 25 Hz during 5 min resulting in 7500 data points per time-series of a single sensor. Note that 2 minutes of recovery phase was not sufficient to recover the sensors baseline and re-establish again the initial conditions in the gas chamber. Hence although we acquired 2 minutes of recovery phase the system was pumping air until the sensors recovered the baseline and the whole gas sample was exhausted from the gas chamber. The readout data was the output voltage of the sensor stored as resistance values according to the voltage-divider scheme and using the value of the load resistor. Hence each data point in the array described the resistance of a sensor R(t) at a certain time of measurement t. The resistancevalues in the data set were normalized by subtracting the baseline value R0 = R(t0) at thestarting point of the measurement t0 and scaling by factor R0 (R(t) âˆ’ R0)/R0. Note that such format of the measured raw data allows for comparison of responses among different sensors. Previously to computing the low-frequency and high-frequency features the raw data were pre-processed by a set of digital filters. A median filter was used to remove the spikes in the signals. Then we employed two Butterworth filters of 3rd order: a low-pass filter (cut-off frequency 0.01 Hz) and a high-pass filter (pass-frequency 0.07 Hz) to generate the low/high frequency signals respectively. Note that these low/high frequency signals (output of the two Butterworth filters) are not distributed within the data set. For feature extraction both low-frequency and high-frequency sensor signals were divided by respiratory cycles where each cycle was processed independently. Thus a feature is referred to as a feature by respiratory cycle. Since high-frequency signals showed oscillatory behavior similar to a sine wave curve we decided to follow a straightforward strategy for feature extraction in this case. We used amplitude of the high-frequency signal (oscillation) at every respiratory cycle as a feature. Low-frequency trajectories had a monotonic behaviour and we used the magnitude of the low-frequency signal as a feature at every respiratory cycle. The magnitude value was taken at the same time of oscillation where the amplitude of the high-frequency signal was measured. Note that the low-frequency and high-frequency features were computed only for the first 13 respiration cycles. In addition to the low/high frequency features we also introduced a cycle-independent feature persingle measurement defined as the maximum of the low-frequency signal over the course ofthe measurement. The first data analysis of the data set was presented in (Ziyatdinov et al. 2014) and the results reported there should be considered as a reference. The study aimed to characterize and explore the sensor signals in response to the modulated gas flow at a fixed respiration frequency. It was expected to confirm a superior performance of the proposed system under the gas flow modulation on the early detection scenario. The acquired modulated signals were decomposed into low-frequency and high-frequency components and the resulted feature sets were compared in terms of the discrimination performance. Note that it was assumed that the low-frequency part of the modulated signals approximate the signals that would be measured under the standard constant flow rate mode (such assumption was empirically confirmed by observing the transient dynamics). The strategy in signal- and data-processing applied in (Ziyatdinov et al. 2014) was straightforward and the analysis can be improved in a number of ways on the stages of feature extraction and/or pattern recognition. Hence the raw data stored in 'rawdata.csv.gz' file is intended for testing feature extraction methods while the features computed in (Ziyatdinov et al. 2014) and stored in 'features.csv' can be readily used in testing pattern recognition methods.

MAGIC Gamma Telescope,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MAGIC+Gamma+Telescope,2007-05-01,Physical,73531,Original Owner: R. K. BockMajor Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov Telescope project (MAGIC)http://wwwmagic.mppmu.mpg.de rkb '@' mail.cern.ch  Donor: P. SavickyInstitute of Computer Science AS of CRCzech Republicsavicky '@' cs.cas.cz ,The data are MC generated (see below) to simulate registration of high energy gamma particles in a ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescope using the imaging technique. Cherenkov gamma telescope observes high energy gamma rays taking advantage of the radiation emitted by charged particles produced inside the electromagnetic showers initiated by the gammas and developing in the atmosphere. This Cherenkov radiation (of visible to UV wavelengths) leaks through the atmosphere and gets recorded in the detector allowing reconstruction of the shower parameters. The available information consists of pulses left by the incoming Cherenkov photons on the photomultiplier tubes arranged in a plane the camera. Depending on the energy of the primary gamma a total of few hundreds to some 10000 Cherenkov photons get collected in patterns (called the shower image) allowing to discriminate statistically those caused by primary gammas (signal) from the images of hadronic showers initiated by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere (background). Typically the image of a shower after some pre-processing is an elongated cluster. Its long axis is oriented towards the camera center if the shower axis is parallel to the telescope's optical axis i.e. if the telescope axis is directed towards a point source. A principal component analysis is performed in the camera plane which results in a correlation axis and defines an ellipse. If the depositions were distributed as a bivariate Gaussian this would be an equidensity ellipse. The characteristic parameters of this ellipse (often called Hillas parameters) are among the image parameters that can be used for discrimination. The energy depositions are typically asymmetric along the major axis and this asymmetry can also be used in discrimination. There are in addition further discriminating characteristics like the extent of the cluster in the image plane or the total sum of depositions. The data set was generated by a Monte Carlo program Corsika described in:    D. Heck et al. CORSIKA A Monte Carlo code to simulate extensive air showers    Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe FZKA 6019 (1998).[Web Link]  The program was run with parameters allowing to observe events with energies down to below 50 GeV.
Gas sensor array exposed to turbulent gas mixtures,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gas+sensor+array+exposed+to+turbulent+gas+mixtures,2014-10-10,Computer,21788,Creators: Jordi Fonollosa (fonollosa '@'ucsd.edu) BioCircutis Institute University of California San Diego San Diego California USA  Donors of the Dataset: Jordi Fonollosa (fonollosa '@'ucsd.edu) Irene Rodriguez-Lujan (irrodriguezlujan '@' ucsd.edu) Marco Trincavelli (marco.trincavelli '@' oru.se) Alexander Vergara Ramon Huerta (rhuerta '@' ucsd.edu) ,A chemical detection platform composed of 8 chemo-resistive gas sensors was exposed to turbulent gas mixtures generated naturally in a wind tunnel. The acquired time series of the sensors are provided. The experimental setup was designed to test gas sensors in realistic environments. Traditionally chemical detection systems based on chemo-resistive sensors include a gas chamber to control the sample air flow and minimize turbulence. Instead we utilized a wind tunnel with two independent gas sources that generate two gas plumes. The plumes get naturally mixed along a turbulent flow and reproduce the gas concentration fluctuations observed in natural environments. Hence the gas sensors can capture the spatio-temporal information contained in the gas plumes. a) Chemical detection platform:The chemical detection platform was composed of 8 MOX gas sensors that generate a time-dependent multivariate response to the different gas stimuli. The utilized sensors were made commercially available by Figaro (TGS2611 TGS2612 TGS2610 TGS2600 TGS2602 TGS2620). The operating temperature of the sensors was controlled by the built-in heater which was kept at a constant voltage of 5V. The detection platform also includes Temperature and Relative Humidity sensors. The generated sensors' responses were acquired at a sampling rate of 20 ms for the whole duration of the experiment. b) Wind tunnel:In order to generate two independent gas plumes in an open environment we built a 2.5 m x 1.2 m x 0.4 m wind tunnel facility with two gas sources (labeled as source1 and source2). Each source was controlled independently to release the selected volatiles at different flow rates which generated different concentration levels in the sensors' position. The wind generator created a turbulent flow that constantly displaced the introduced volatiles towards the exhaust outlet. c) Experimental protocol:We exposed the detection unit to mixtures of Ethylene with Methane or Carbon Monoxide. The mixtures were originated releasing Ethylene at source1 and releasing Methane / Carbon Monoxide at source2. Each volatile was released at four different flows (zero z low l medium m and high h) providing up to 30 different mixture configurations: 15 mixtures of Ethylene with CO (h+h h+m h+l â€¦ z+h z+m z+l) and 15 mixtures of Ethylene with Methane. Each configuration was repeated 6 times. Hence the complete dataset was composed of 180 measurements which were performed in a random order.  By means of a GCMS system the mean concentration levels at the sensors' location were estimated: Ethylene (l: 31 ppm m: 46 ppm h: 96 ppm) CO (l: 270 ppm m: 397 ppm h: 460 ppm) Methane (l: 51 ppm m: 115 ppm h: 131 ppm). It is worth noting that GC-MS systems only provide the mean value of the concentration and are not sensitive to concentration fluctuations. Each measurement which had a total duration of 300 seconds was performed as follows: Initially no gas was released and clean air flowed along the wind tunnel. 60 seconds after both sources started to release the corresponding volatile at the specified flow rate. The duration of the gas release was 180 s. Finally the system acquired the recovery to the baseline for another 60 s.

Please contact duhadway '@' google.com if you have any questions.,YouTube Comedy Slam ([Web Link]) is a video discovery experiment running on YouTube's version of labs (called TestTube) for a few months in 2011 and 2012. In this experiment a pair of videos were shown to the user and the user was asked to vote for the video that they found funnier. Left/right positions of the videos were randomly selected before being presented to the user to eliminate position bias. Videos were selected from a large pool of weekly updated sets of videos. One of the outcomes of this experiment is a training dataset for automatically predicting which video would be deemed funnier by users using a variety of features.  For example uploader supplied metadata and/or user comments on watch pages of these videos could be used as features. See [Web Link] for more detail. The attached dataset includes roughly 1.7 million preference votes. The votes were recorded chronologically. The first 80% are provided here as the training dataset and the remaining 20% as the testing dataset. Each line in this dataset corresponds to one vote over a pair of YouTube videos. Each video is represented by its YouTube video ID. For example the watch page URL for video ID 'txqiwrbYGrs' is [Web Link]. User preference over a pair of videos is presented in the form of string â€œleftâ€ if the left video was deemed funnier and â€œrightâ€ otherwise. This user vote should be used as ground truth for both training and testing. Evaluation should be based on average accuracy in predicting this preference over the testing partition (provided).

Nine male speakers uttered two Japanese vowels /ae/ successively. For each utterance with the analysis parameters described below we applied 12-degree linear prediction analysis to it to obtain a discrete-time series with 12 LPC cepstrum coefficients. This means that one utterance by a speaker forms a time series whose length is in the range 7-29 and each point of a time series is of 12 features (12 coefficients). The number of the time series is 640 in total. We used one set of 270 time series for training and the other set of 370 time series for testing. Number of Instances (Utterances):     * Training: 270 (30 utterances by 9 speakers. See file 'size_ae.train'.)    * Testing: 370 (24-88 utterances by the same 9 speakers in different opportunities. See file 'size_ae.test'.)  Length of Time Series:     * 7 - 29 depending on utterances  Analysis parameters:     * Sampling rate : 10kHz    * Frame length : 25.6 ms    * Shift length : 6.4ms    * Degree of LPC coefficients : 12  Files:     * Training file: ae.train    * Testing file: ae.test  Format: Each line in ae.train or ae.test represents 12 LPC coefficients in the increasing order separated by spaces. This corresponds to one analysis frame. Lines are organized into blocks which are a set of 7-29 lines separated by blank lines and corresponds to a single speech utterance of /ae/ with 7-29 frames. Each speaker is a set of consecutive blocks. In ae.train there are 30 blocks for each speaker. Blocks 1-30 represent speaker 1 blocks 31-60 represent speaker 2 and so on up to speaker 9. In ae.test speakers 1 to 9 have the corresponding number of blocks: 31 35 88 44 29 24 40 50 29. Thus blocks 1-31 represent speaker 1 (31 utterances of /ae/) blocks 32-66 represent speaker 2 (35 utterances of /ae/) and so on.
LSVT Voice Rehabilitation,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/LSVT+Voice+Rehabilitation,2014-02-19,Life,19122,The dataset was created by Athanasios Tsanas (tsanasthanasis '@' gmail.com) of the University of Oxford.,The original paper demonstrated that it is possible to correctly replicate the experts' binary assessment with approximately 90% accuracy using both 10-fold cross-validation and leave-one-subject-out validation. We experimented with both random forests and support vector machines using standard approaches for optimizing the SVM's hyperparameters. It will be interesting if researchers can improve on this finding using advanced machine learning tools. Details for the dataset can be found on the following paper.A. Tsanas M.A. Little C. Fox L.O.

Indoor User Movement Prediction from RSS data,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Indoor+User+Movement+Prediction+from+RSS+data,2016-02-04,Computer,28163,Davide Bacciu (a) Paolo Barsocchi (b) Stefano Chessa (a) Claudio Gallicchio (a) Alessio Micheli (a) (a) Department of Computer Science University of Pisa.Largo Bruno Pontecorvo 3 56127 Pisa Italy(b) Institute of Information Science and Technologies  Italian National Research Council.Via G. Moruzzi 1 56124 Pisa Italy For info about this dataset contactPaolo Barsocchi: paolo.barsocchi '@' isti.cnr.itClaudio Gallicchio: gallicch '@' di.unipi.it,This dataset represents a real-life benchmark in the area of Ambient Assisted Living applications as described in [1].The binary classification task consists in predicting  the pattern of user movements in real-world office environments from time-series generated by a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Input data contains temporal streams of radio signal strength (RSS) measured between the nodes of a WSN comprising 5 sensors: 4 anchors deployed in the environment and 1 mote worn by the user. Data has been collected during user movements at the frequency of 8 Hz (8 samples per second). In the provided dataset the RSS signals have been rescaled to the interval [-11] singly on the set of traces collected from each anchor (as in [1]).Target data consists in a class label indicating whether the user's trajectory will lead to a change in the spatial context (i.e. a room change) or not. In particular the target class +1 is associated to the location changing movements while the target class -1 is associated to the location preserving movements.The measurement campaign involved a number of 3 different environmental settings each of which comprises 2 rooms (containing typical office furniture) separated by a corridor. A sketch of the common setup considered is provided in the attached Figure. In each environmental setting the anchors are deployed in fixed positions near the rooms corners (at the height of 1.5 m from the ground) while the mobile is worn on the chest of the user. The Figure also shows a simplified illustration of the types of user trajectories considered with straight paths yielding to a spatial context change and curved ones leading to spatial context preservation. Each path produces a trace of RSS measurements from the beginning of the trajectory until a marker point which is denoted as M in the Figure. The marker M is the same for all the movements therefore different paths cannot be distinguished based only on the RSS values collected at M. Each input file in the provided dataset contains data pertaining to one temporal sequence of input RSS data (1 user trajectory for each file). The dataset contains 314 sequences for a total number of 13197 steps. Further information can be found at the webpage: [Web Link].A complete description of this dataset can be found in [1] which also provides details on the performance achieved by Echo State Networks on the corresponding classification task.

Fractions have been converted to decimals numbers have been freely translated to and from scientific notation and zeros have sometimes been added to decimal numbers to facilitate tabulation. Any additional deviations from verbatim transcription are noted in the Comments entry of the associated case.  Note in particular that in a few clearly identified cases apparent typographical errors have been corrected and that in others data points identified by the reporting scientist as *not* conforming to the proposed relationship have been omitted.
Reuters-21578 Text Categorization Collection,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Reuters-21578+Text+Categorization+Collection,1997-09-26,N/A,105566,David D. LewisAT&T Labs - Research     lewis '@' research.att.com  Documents came from Reuters newswire in 1987.,From the original readme file (please consult it for more information):-------------------------The documents in the Reuters-21578 collection appeared on the Reuters newswire in 1987.  The documents were assembled and indexed with categories by personnel from Reuters Ltd. (Sam Dobbins Mike Topliss Steve Weinstein) and Carnegie Group Inc. (Peggy Andersen Monica Cellio Phil Hayes Laura Knecht Irene Nirenburg) in 1987.   In 1990 the documents were made available by Reuters and CGI for research purposes to the Information Retrieval Laboratory (W.  Bruce Croft Director) of the Computer and Information Science Department at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.  Formatting of the documents and production of associated data files was done in 1990 by David D.  Lewis and Stephen Harding at the Information Retrieval Laboratory. Further formatting and data file production was done in 1991 and 1992 by David D. Lewis and Peter Shoemaker at the Center for Information and Language Studies University of Chicago.  This version of the data was made available for anonymous FTP as "Reuters-22173 Distribution 1.0" in January 1993. From 1993 through 1996 Distribution 1.0 was hosted at a succession of FTP sites maintained by the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (W. Bruce Croft Director) of the Computer Science Department at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. At the ACM SIGIR '96 conference in August 1996 a group of text categorization researchers discussed how published results on Reuters-22173 could be made more comparable across studies.  It was decided that a new version of collection should be produced with less ambiguous formatting and including documentation carefully spelling out standard methods of using the collection.  The opportunity would also be used to correct a variety of typographical and other errors in the categorization and formatting of the collection. Steve Finch and David D. Lewis did this cleanup of the collection September through November of 1996 relying heavily on Finch's SGML-tagged version of the collection from an earlier study.  One result of the re-examination of the collection was the removal of 595 documents which were exact duplicates (based on identity of timestamps down to the second) of other documents in the collection. The new collection therefore has only 21578 documents and thus is called the Reuters-21578 collection.  This README describes version 1.0 of this new collection which we refer to as "Reuters-21578 Distribution 1.0". In preparing the collection and documentation we have benefited from discussions with Eric Brown William Cohen Fred Damerau Yoram Singer Amit Singhal and Yiming Yang among many others. We thank all the people and organizations listed above for their efforts and support without which this collection would not exist.
Geographical Original of Music,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Geographical+Original+of+Music,2014-10-18,N/A,44995,Creators:Fang Zhou (fang.zhou '@' nottingham.edu.cn)The University of Nottinghan Ningbo China Donors of the Dataset:Fang Zhou (fang.zhou '@' nottingham.edu.cn)Claire Q (eskoala '@' gmail.com)Ross D. King (ross.king '@' manchester.ac.uk), The dataset was built from a personal collection of 1059 tracks covering 33 countries/area. The music used is traditional ethnic or `world' only as classified by the publishers of the product on which it appears. Any Western music is not included because its influence is global - what we seek are the aspects of music that most influence location. Thus being able to specify a location with strong influence on the music is central.  The geographical location of origin was manually collected the information from the CD sleeve notes and when this information was inadequate we searched other information sources. The location data is limited in precision to the country of origin.   The country of origin was determined by the artist's or artists' main country/area of residence.  Any track that had ambiguous origin is not included.  We have taken the position of each country's capital city (or the province of the area) by latitude and longitude as the absolute point of origin. The program MARSYAS[1] was used to extract audio features from the wave files. We used the default MARSYAS settings in single vector format (68 features) to estimate the performance with basic timbal information covering the entire length of each track. No feature weighting or pre-filtering was applied. All features were transformed to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. We also investigated the utility of adding chromatic attributes. These describe the notes of the scale being used. This is especially important as a distinguishing feature in geographical ethnomusicology. The chromatic features provided by MARSYAS are 12 per octave - Western tuning but it may be possible to tell something from how similar to or different from Western tuning the music is. [1] G.

Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T) Ambient Pressure (AP) Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP)  of the plant.A combined cycle power plant (CCPP) is composed of gas turbines (GT) steam turbines (ST) and heat recovery steam generators. In a CCPP the electricity is generated by gas and steam turbines which are combined in one cycle and is transferred from one turbine to another. While the Vacuum is colected from and has effect on the Steam Turbine he other three of the ambient variables effect the GT performance.For comparability with our baseline studies and to allow 5x2 fold statistical tests be carried out we provide the data shuffled five times. For each shuffling 2-fold CV is carried out and the resulting 10 measurements are used for statistical testing.We provide the data both in .ods and in .xlsx formats.

The training data belongs to 20 PWP (6 female 14 male) and 20 healthy individuals (10 female 10 male) who appealed at the Department of Neurology in Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine Istanbul University. From all subjects multiple types of sound recordings (26 voice samples including sustained vowels numbers words and short sentences) are taken.  A group of 26 linear and timeâ€“frequency based features are extracted from each voice sample. UPDRS ((Unified Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Rating Scale) score of each patient which is determined by expert physician is also available in this dataset. Therefore this dataset can also be used for regression. After collecting the training dataset which consists of multiple types of sound recordings and performing our experiments in line with the obtained findings we continued collecting an independent test set from PWP via the same physicianâ€™s examination process under the same conditions. During the collection of this dataset 28 PD patients are asked to say only the sustained vowels 'a' and 'o' three times respectively which makes a total of 168 recordings. The same 26 features are extracted from voice samples of this dataset. This dataset can be used as an independent test set to validate the results obtained on training set.

Phishing Websites,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Phishing+Websites,2015-03-26,Computer Security,56847,Rami Mustafa A Mohammad ( University of Huddersfield rami.mohammad '@' hud.ac.uk rami.mustafa.a '@' gmail.com)Lee McCluskey (University of Huddersfieldt.l.mccluskey '@' hud.ac.uk ) Fadi Thabtah (Canadian University of Dubaifadi '@' cud.ac.ae),One of the challenges faced by our research was the unavailability of reliable training datasets. In fact this challenge faces any researcher in the field. However although plenty of articles about predicting phishing websites have been disseminated these days no reliable training dataset has been published publically may be because there is no agreement in literature on the definitive features that characterize phishing webpages hence it is difficult to shape a dataset that covers all possible features. In this dataset we shed light on the important features that have proved to be sound and effective in predicting phishing websites. In addition we propose some new features.
Statlog (Landsat Satellite),https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+%28Landsat+Satellite%29,1993-02-13,Physical,83942,    Ashwin Srinivasan     Department of Statistics and Data Modeling     University of Strathclyde     Glasgow     Scotland     UK ross '@' uk.ac.turing  The original Landsat data for this database was generatedfrom data purchased from NASA by the Australian Centrefor Remote Sensing and used for research at:The Centre for Remote SensingUniversity of New South WalesKensington PO Box 1NSW 2033Australia.      The sample database was generated taking a small section (82     rows and 100 columns) from the original data. The binary values     were converted to their present ASCII form by Ashwin Srinivasan.     The classification for each pixel was performed on the basis of     an actual site visit by Ms. Karen Hall when working for Professor     John A. Richards at the Centre for Remote Sensing at the University     of New South Wales Australia. Conversion to 3x3 neighbourhoods and     splitting into test and training sets was done by Alistair Sutherland.,The database consists of the multi-spectral values of pixels in 3x3 neighbourhoods in a satellite image and the classification associated with the central pixel in each neighbourhood. The aim is to predict this classification given the multi-spectral values. In the sample database the class of a pixel is coded as a number. The Landsat satellite data is one of the many sources of information available for a scene. The interpretation of a scene by integrating spatial data of diverse types and resolutions including multispectral and radar data maps indicating topography land use etc. is expected to assume significant importance with the onset of an era characterised by integrative approaches to remote sensing (for example NASA's Earth Observing System commencing this decade). Existing statistical methods are ill-equipped for handling such diverse data types. Note that this is not true for Landsat MSS data considered in isolation (as in this sample database). This data satisfies the important requirements of being numerical and at a single resolution and standard maximum-likelihood classification performs very well. Consequently for this data it should be interesting to compare the performance of other methods against the statistical approach. One frame of Landsat MSS imagery consists of four digital images of the same scene in different spectral bands. Two of these are in the visible region (corresponding approximately to green and red regions of the visible spectrum) and two are in the (near) infra-red. Each pixel is a 8-bit binary word with 0 corresponding to black and 255 to white. The spatial resolution of a pixel is about 80m x 80m. Each image contains 2340 x 3380 such pixels. The database is a (tiny) sub-area of a scene consisting of 82 x 100 pixels. Each line of data corresponds to a 3x3 square neighbourhood of pixels completely contained within the 82x100 sub-area. Each line contains the pixel values in the four spectral bands (converted to ASCII) of each of the 9 pixels in the 3x3 neighbourhood and a number indicating the classification label of the central pixel. The number is a code for the following classes: NumberClass1red soil2cotton crop3grey soil4damp grey soil5soil with vegetation stubble6mixture class (all types present)7very damp grey soil NB. There are no examples with class 6 in this dataset. The data is given in random order and certain lines of data have been removed so you cannot reconstruct the original image from this dataset. In each line of data the four spectral values for the top-left pixel are given first followed by the four spectral values for the top-middle pixel and then those for the top-right pixel and so on with the pixels read out in sequence left-to-right and top-to-bottom. Thus the four spectral values for the central pixel are given by attributes 171819 and 20. If you like you can use only these four attributes while ignoring the others. This avoids the problem which arises when a 3x3 neighbourhood straddles a boundary.
Character Trajectories,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Character+Trajectories,2008-08-20,Computer,105934,Ben H Williams School of InformaticsUniversity of Edinburghben.williams '@' ed.ac.uk ,The characters here were used for a PhD study on primitive extraction using HMM based models. The data consists of 2858 character samples contained in the cell array 'mixout'. The struct variable 'consts' contains a field consts.charlabels which provides ennummerated labels for the characters. consts.key provides the key for each label. The data was captured using a WACOM tablet. 3 Dimensions were kept - x y and pen tip force. The data has been numerically differentiated and Gaussian smoothed with a sigma value of 2. Data was captured at 200Hz. The data was normalised with consts.datanorm. Only characters with a single 'PEN-DOWN' segment were considered. Character segmentation was performed using a pen tip force cut-off point. The characters have also been shifted so that their velocity profiles best match the mean of the set.

Employs a relational representation for states with each square given a unique name and square connectivity computed by an enumeration of connected relations. Generates legal moves by first generating peusdo moves then eliminating those that result in the moving player being in check. 3) chess_russell_wyl: Originally written by Stuart Russell in MRS translated into prolog by flann '@' cs.orst.edu. Employs a geometric representation for states with each square designated by an XY coordinate and square connectivity computed by vectors. Generates legal moves by determining whether the moving side is in check. If the moving side is in check moves are generated that destroy the check threat. If the moving side is not in check moves are generated that do not create a check threat. Note that if the moving side is in check from multiple threats then the domain theory generates incorrect moves. 4) chess_vijay_1: Written by vijay '@' cs.orst.edu. Employs a relational representation for states with each square given a unique name and square connectivity computed by an enumeration of connected relations. Generates legal moves by first generating peusdo moves then eliminating those that result in the moving player being in check. 5) chess_vijay_2: Written by vijay '@' cs.orst.edu. Employs a geometric representation for states with each square designated by an XY coordinate and square connectivity computed by vectors. Generates legal moves by first generating peusdo moves then eliminating those that result in the moving player being in check. 6) chess_vijay_3: Written by vijay '@' cs.orst.edu. Employs a special linear representation for states with each square designated by a single number and square connectivity computed by a single delta value. Generates legal moves by first generating peusdo moves then eliminating those that result in the moving player being in check. Each domain theory includes a sample state called state1 that describes the board position illustrated as Figure 4(d) in Flann and Dietterich "A study of explanation-based methods for inductive learning" in Machine Learning 4 187-226. See file test_domain_theories for an example of loading and running the domain theories. In addition to the domain theories a file called support_code is included that contains some useful prolog routines. One routine takes a generic chess board description and a domain theory name and produces a prolog state description suitable for use with the given domain theory.

KurganUniversity of Colorado at Denver Denver CO 80217 U.S.A.Krys.Cios '@' cudenver.edu Lucy S. GoodendayMedical College of Ohio OH U.S.A. Donors:  Lukasz A.Kurgan Krzysztof J. Cios,The dataset describes diagnosing of cardiac Single Proton Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) images. Each of the patients is classified into two categories: normal and abnormal. The database of 267 SPECT image sets (patients) was processed to extract features that summarize the original SPECT images. As a result 44 continuous feature pattern was created for each patient. The pattern was further processed to obtain 22 binary feature patterns. The CLIP3 algorithm was used to generate classification rules from these patterns. The CLIP3 algorithm generated rules that were 84.0% accurate (as compared with cardilogists' diagnoses). SPECT is a good data set for testing ML algorithms; it has 267 instances that are descibed by 23 binary attributes

KaynakDepartment of Computer EngineeringBogazici University 80815 Istanbul Turkeyalpaydin '@' boun.edu.tr,We used preprocessing programs made available by NIST to extract normalized bitmaps of handwritten digits from a preprinted form. From a total of 43 people 30 contributed to the training set and different 13 to the test set. 32x32 bitmaps are divided into nonoverlapping blocks of 4x4 and the number of on pixels are counted in each block. This generates an input matrix of 8x8 where each element is an integer in the range 0..16. This reduces dimensionality and gives invariance to small distortions.

Challenger USA Space Shuttle O-Ring,https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Challenger+USA+Space+Shuttle+O-Ring,1993-08-05,Physical,78835,Original Owner: David Draper (draper '@' math.ucla.edu)University of California Los Angeles Donor:  David Draper (draper '@' math.ucla.edu),There are two databases: (both use the same set of 5 attributes):1. Primary o-ring erosion and/or blowby2. Primary o-ring erosion only The two databases are identical except for the 2nd attribute of the 21st instance (confirmed by David Draper on 8/5/93). Edited from (Draper 1993): The motivation for collecting this database was the explosion of the USA Space Shuttle Challenger on 28 January 1986.  An investigation ensued into the reliability of the shuttle's propulsion system.  The explosion was eventually traced to the failure of one of the three field joints on one of the two solid booster rockets.  Each of these six field joints includes two O-rings designated as primary and secondary which fail when phenomena called erosion and blowby both occur.  The night before the launch a decision had to be made regarding launch safety.  The discussion among engineers and managers leading to this decision included concern that the probability of failure of the O-rings depended on the temperature t at launch which was forecase to be 31 degrees F. There are strong engineering reasons based on the composition of O-rings to support the judgment that failure probability may rise monotonically as temperature drops.  One other variable the pressure s at which safety testing for field join leaks was performed was available but its relevance to the failure process was unclear. Draper's paper includes a menacing figure graphing the number of field joints experiencing stress vs. liftoff temperature for the 23 shuttle flights previous to the Challenger disaster.  No previous liftoff temperature was under 53 degrees F.  Although tremendous extrapolation must be done from the given data to assess risk at 31 degrees F it is obvious even to the layman "to foresee the unacceptably high risk created by launching at 31 degrees F."  For more information see Draper (1993) or the other previous analyses. The task is to predict the number of O-rings that will experience thermal distress for a given flight when the launch temperature is below freezing.
